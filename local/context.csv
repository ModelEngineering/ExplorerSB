Yeast-cell-cycle-Irons-J-Theor-Biol-2009,"BACKGROUND: Qualitative frameworks, especially those based on the logical discrete formalism, are increasingly used to model regulatory and signalling networks. A major advantage of these frameworks is that they do not require precise quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large networks. While numerous groups have developed specific computational tools that provide original methods to analyse qualitative models, a standard format to exchange qualitative models has been missing. RESULTS: We present the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Qualitative Models Package (“qual”), an extension of the SBML Level 3 standard designed for computer representation of qualitative models of biological networks. We demonstrate the interoperability of models via SBML qual through the analysis of a specific signalling network by three independent software tools. Furthermore, the collective effort to define the SBML qual format paved the way for the development of LogicalModel, an open-source model library, which will facilitate the adoption of the format as well as the collaborative development of algorithms to analyse qualitative models. CONCLUSIONS: SBML qual allows the exchange of qualitative models among a number of complementary software tools. SBML qual has the potential to promote collaborative work on the development of novel computational approaches, as well as on the specification and the analysis of comprehensive qualitative models of regulatory and signalling networks.","DJ Irons.

Escherichia-coli-core-metabolism-textbook,"BACKGROUND: COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software. RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function; however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance, COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented framework designed to meet the computational challenges associated with the next generation of stoichiometric constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

It has been updated and periodically released since then based on new and curated genomic and biochemical knowledge. An update has now been built, named iJO1366, which accounts for 1366 genes, 2251 metabolic reactions, and 1136 unique metabolites. iJO1366 was (1) updated in part using a new experimental screen of 1075 gene knockout strains, illuminating cases where alternative pathways and isozymes are yet to be discovered, (2) compared with its predecessor and to experimental data sets to confirm that it continues to make accurate phenotypic predictions of growth on different substrates and for gene knockout strains, and (3) mapped to the genomes of all available sequenced E. coli strains, including pathogens, leading to the identification of hundreds of unannotated genes in these organisms. Like its predecessors, the iJO1366 reconstruction is expected to be widely deployed for studying the systems biology of E. coli and for metabolic engineering applications.","Ana Bulović, Stephan Fischer, Marc Dinh, Felipe Golib, Wolfram Liebermeister, Christian Poirier, Laurent Tournier, Edda Klipp, Vincent Fromion & Anne Goelzer.

Hodgkin-Huxley-cell-Gleeson,"Computational models are increasingly important for studying complex neurophysiological systems. As scientific tools, it is essential that such models can be reproduced and critically evaluated by a range of scientists. However, published models are currently implemented using a diverse set of modeling approaches, simulation tools, and computer languages making them inaccessible and difficult to reproduce. Models also typically contain concepts that are tightly linked to domain-specific simulators, or depend on knowledge that is described exclusively in text-based documentation. To address these issues we have developed a compact, hierarchical, XML-based language called LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification), that can define the structure and dynamics of a wide range of biological models in a fully machine readable format. We describe how LEMS underpins the latest version of NeuroML and show that this framework can define models of ion channels, synapses, neurons and networks. Unit handling, often a source of error when reusing models, is built into the core of the language by specifying physical quantities in models in terms of the base dimensions. We show how LEMS, together with the open source Java and Python based libraries we have developed, facilitates the generation of scripts for multiple neuronal simulators and provides a route for simulator free code generation. We establish that LEMS can be used to define models from systems biology and map them to neuroscience-domain specific simulators, enabling models to be shared between these traditionally separate disciplines. LEMS and NeuroML 2 provide a new, comprehensive framework for defining computational models of neuronal and other biological systems in a machine readable format, making them more reproducible and increasing the transparency and accessibility of their underlying structure and properties.","Robert C.

Iron-distribution-Parmar-BMC-Syst-Biol-2017,"BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential element of most living organisms but is a dangerous substance when poorly liganded in solution. The hormone hepcidin regulates the export of iron from tissues to the plasma contributing to iron homeostasis and also restricting its availability to infectious agents. Disruption of iron regulation in mammals leads to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and contributes to the etiology of several other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that hepcidin alone is able to regulate iron distribution in different dietary regimes in the mouse using a computational model of iron distribution calibrated with radioiron tracer data. RESULTS: A model was developed and calibrated to the data from adequate iron diet, which was able to simulate the iron distribution under a low iron diet. However simulation of high iron diet shows considerable deviations from the experimental data. Namely the model predicts more iron in red blood cells and less iron in the liver than what was observed in experiments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hepcidin alone is not sufficient to regulate iron homeostasis in high iron conditions and that other factors are important. The model was able to simulate anemia when hepcidin was increased but was unable to simulate hemochromatosis when hepcidin was suppressed, suggesting that in high iron conditions additional regulatory interactions are important.

Lorenz-system-Garny,"Computational biologists have been developing standards and formats for nearly two decades, with the aim of easing the description and exchange of experimental data, mathematical models, simulation experiments, etc. One of those efforts is CellML (cellml.org), an XML-based markup language for the encoding of mathematical models. Early CellML-based environments include COR and OpenCell. However, both of those tools have limitations and were eventually replaced with OpenCOR (opencor.ws). OpenCOR is an open source modeling environment that is supported on Windows, Linux and OS X. It relies on a modular approach, which means that all of its features come in the form of plugins. Those plugins can be used to organize, edit, simulate and analyze models encoded in the CellML format. We start with an introduction to CellML and two of its early adopters, which limitations eventually led to the development of OpenCOR. We then go onto describing the general philosophy behind OpenCOR, as well as describing its openness and its development process. Next, we illustrate various aspects of OpenCOR, such as its user interface and some of the plugins that come bundled with it (e.g., its editing and simulation plugins). Finally, we discuss some of the advantages and limitations of OpenCOR before drawing some concluding remarks.",Alan Garny & Peter J. Hunter.

NFAT-translocation-Tomida-EMBO-J-2003,"Transcription by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is regulated by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation. However, why and how Ca(2+) oscillation regulates NFAT activity remain elusive. NFAT is dephosphorylated by Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to initiate transcription. We analyzed the kinetics of dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT. We show that Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphoryl ation proceeds rapidly, while the rephosphorylation and nuclear transport of NFAT proceed slowly. Therefore, after brief Ca(2+) stimulation, dephosphoryl ated NFAT has a lifetime of several minutes in the cytoplasm. Thus, Ca(2+) oscillation induces a build-up of dephosphorylated NFAT in the cytoplasm, allowing effective nuclear translocation, provided that the oscillation interval is shorter than the lifetime of dephos phorylated NFAT. We also show that Ca(2+) oscillation is more cost-effective in inducing the translocation of NFAT than continuous Ca(2+) signaling. Thus, the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT functions as a working memory of Ca(2+) signals and enables the control of NFAT nuclear translocation by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation at a reduced cost of Ca(2+) signaling.","Taichiro Tomida, Kenzo Hirose, Azusa Takizawa, Futoshi Shibasaki & Masamitsu Iino.

NHEJ-Dolan-PLoS-Comput-Biol-2015,"Unrepaired or inaccurately repaired DNA damage can lead to a range of cell fates, such as apoptosis, cellular senescence or cancer, depending on the efficiency and accuracy of DNA damage repair and on the downstream DNA damage signalling. DNA damage repair and signalling have been studied and modelled in detail separately, but it is not yet clear how they integrate with one another to control cell fate. In this study, we have created an integrated stochastic model of DNA damage repair by non-homologous end joining and of gamma irradiation-induced cellular senescence in human cells that are not apoptosis-prone. The integrated model successfully explains the changes that occur in the dynamics of DNA damage repair after irradiation. Simulations of p53/p21 dynamics after irradiation agree well with previously published experimental studies, further validating the model. Additionally, the model predicts, and we offer some experimental support, that low-dose fractionated irradiation of cells leads to temporal patterns in p53/p21 that lead to significant cellular senescence. The integrated model is valuable for studying the processes of DNA damage induced cell fate and predicting the effectiveness of DNA damage related medical interventions at the cellular level.","David W.

mTOR-signaling-Varusai-Sci-Rep-2018,"The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signalling network is an evolutionarily conserved network that controls key cellular processes, including cell growth and metabolism. Consisting of the major kinase complexes mTOR Complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2), the mTOR network harbours complex interactions and feedback loops. The DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) was recently identified as an endogenous inhibitor of both mTORC1 and 2 through direct interactions, and is in turn degraded by mTORC1/2, adding an extra layer of complexity to the mTOR network. Yet, the dynamic properties of the DEPTOR-mTOR network and the roles of DEPTOR in coordinating mTORC1/2 activation dynamics have not been characterised. Using computational modelling, systems analysis and dynamic simulations we show that DEPTOR confers remarkably rich and complex dynamic behaviours to mTOR signalling, including abrupt, bistable switches, oscillations and co-existing bistable/oscillatory responses. Transitions between these distinct modes of behaviour are enabled by modulating DEPTOR expression alone. We characterise the governing conditions for the observed dynamics by elucidating the network in its vast multi-dimensional parameter space, and develop strategies to identify core network design motifs underlying these dynamics. Our findings provide new systems-level insights into the complexity of mTOR signalling contributed by DEPTOR.","Thawfeek M Varusai & Lan K Nguyen.

iAB_RBC_283,"BACKGROUND: The development of high-throughput technologies capable of whole cell measurements of genes, proteins, and metabolites has led to the emergence of systems biology. Integrated analysis of the resulting omic data sets has proved to be hard to achieve. Metabolic network reconstructions enable complex relationships amongst molecular components to be represented formally in a biologically relevant manner while respecting physical constraints. In silico models derived from such reconstructions can then be queried or interrogated through mathematical simulations. Proteomic profiling studies of the mature human erythrocyte have shown more proteins present related to metabolic function than previously thought; however the significance and the causal consequences of these findings have not been explored. RESULTS: Erythrocyte proteomic data was used to reconstruct the most expansive description of erythrocyte metabolism to date, following extensive manual curation, assessment of the literature, and functional testing. The reconstruction contains 281 enzymes representing functions from glycolysis to cofactor and amino acid metabolism. Such a comprehensive view of erythrocyte metabolism implicates the erythrocyte as a potential biomarker for different diseases as well as a 'cell-based' drug-screening tool. The analysis shows that 94 erythrocyte enzymes are implicated in morbid single nucleotide polymorphisms, representing 142 pathologies. In addition, over 230 FDA-approved and experimental pharmaceuticals have enzymatic targets in the erythrocyte. CONCLUSION: The advancement of proteomic technologies and increased generation of high-throughput proteomic data have created the need for a means to analyze these data in a coherent manner. Network reconstructions provide a systematic means to integrate and analyze proteomic data in a biologically meaning manner. Analysis of the red cell proteome has revealed an unexpected level of complexity in the functional capabilities of human erythrocyte metabolism.","Aarash Bordbar, Neema Jamshidi & Bernhard O Palsson. iAB-RBC-283: A proteomically derived knowledge-base of erythrocyte metabolism that can be used to simulate its physiological and patho-physiological states.

There were 17 different substrate/target pairs for which over 80% of the theoretical maximum potential could be achieved. The developed method introduces a new concept of objective function tilting for strain design. This study provides specific metabolic interventions (strain designs) for production strains that can be experimentally implemented, characterizes the potential for E. coli to produce native compounds, and outlines a strain design pipeline that can be utilized to design production strains for additional organisms.","Adam M.

iAF987,"Geobacter species are of great interest for environmental and biotechnology applications as they can carry out direct electron transfer to insoluble metals or other microorganisms and have the ability to assimilate inorganic carbon. Here, we report on the capability and key enabling metabolic machinery of Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 to carry out CO(2) fixation and direct electron transfer to iron. An updated metabolic reconstruction was generated, growth screens on targeted conditions of interest were performed, and constraint-based analysis was utilized to characterize and evaluate critical pathways and reactions in G. metallireducens. The novel capability of G. metallireducens to grow autotrophically with formate and Fe(III) was predicted and subsequently validated in vivo. Additionally, the energetic cost of transferring electrons to an external electron acceptor was determined through analysis of growth experiments carried out using three different electron acceptors (Fe(III), nitrate, and fumarate) by systematically isolating and examining different parts of the electron transport chain. The updated reconstruction will serve as a knowledgebase for understanding and engineering Geobacter and similar species.","Adam M.

To understand the diversity among stages and species, we reconstructed genome-scale metabolic models (GeMMs) of metabolism for five life cycle stages and five species of Plasmodium spanning the blood, transmission, and mosquito stages. The stage-specific models of Plasmodium falciparum uncovered stage-dependent changes in central carbon metabolism and predicted potential targets that could affect several life cycle stages. The species-specific models further highlight differences between experimental animal models and the human-infecting species. Comparisons between human- and rodent-infecting species revealed differences in thiamine (vitamin B1), choline, and pantothenate (vitamin B5) metabolism. Thus, we show that genome-scale analysis of multiple stages and species of Plasmodium can prioritize potential drug targets that could be both anti-malarials and transmission blocking agents, in addition to guiding translation from non-human experimental disease models.","Alyaa M.

iEK1008,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antibiotics against M. tuberculosis has been shown to be influenced by experimental media conditions. Investigations of M. tuberculosis growth in physiological conditions have described an environment that is different from common in vitro media. Thus, elucidating the interplay between available nutrient sources and antibiotic efficacy has clear medical relevance. While genome-scale reconstructions of M. tuberculosis have enabled the ability to interrogate media differences for the past 10 years, recent reconstructions have diverged from each other without standardization. A unified reconstruction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv would elucidate the impact of different nutrient conditions on antibiotic efficacy and provide new insights for therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: We present a new genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, named iEK1011, that unifies and updates previous M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome-scale reconstructions. We functionally assess iEK1011 against previous models and show that the model increases correct gene essentiality predictions on two different experimental datasets by 6% (53% to 60%) and 18% (60% to 71%), respectively. We compared simulations between in vitro and approximated in vivo media conditions to examine the predictive capabilities of iEK1011. The simulated differences recapitulated literature defined characteristics in the rewiring of TCA metabolism including succinate secretion, gluconeogenesis, and activation of both the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. To assist efforts to elucidate mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development, we curated 16 metabolic genes related to antimicrobial resistance and approximated evolutionary drivers of resistance. Comparing simulations of these antibiotic resistance features between in vivo and in vitro media highlighted condition-dependent differences that may influence the efficacy of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: iEK1011 provides a computational knowledge base for exploring the impact of different environmental conditions on the metabolic state of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. As more experimental data and knowledge of M. tuberculosis H37Rv become available, a unified and standardized M. tuberculosis model will prove to be a valuable resource to the research community studying the systems biology of M. tuberculosis.

iHN637,"BACKGROUND: The metabolic capabilities of acetogens to ferment a wide range of sugars, to grow autotrophically on H(2)/CO(2), and more importantly on synthesis gas (H(2)/CO/CO(2)) make them very attractive candidates as production hosts for biofuels and biocommodities. Acetogenic metabolism is considered one of the earliest modes of bacterial metabolism. A thorough understanding of various factors governing the metabolism, in particular energy conservation mechanisms, is critical for metabolic engineering of acetogens for targeted production of desired chemicals. RESULTS: Here, we present the genome-scale metabolic network of Clostridium ljungdahlii, the first such model for an acetogen. This genome-scale model (iHN637) consisting of 637 genes, 785 reactions, and 698 metabolites captures all the major central metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, in particular pathways involved in carbon fixation and energy conservation. A combination of metabolic modeling, with physiological and transcriptomic data provided insights into autotrophic metabolism as well as aided the characterization of a nitrate reduction pathway in C. ljungdahlii. Analysis of the iHN637 metabolic model revealed that flavin based electron bifurcation played a key role in energy conservation during autotrophic growth and helped identify genes for some of the critical steps in this mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: iHN637 represents a predictive model that recapitulates experimental data, and provides valuable insights into the metabolic response of C. ljungdahlii to genetic perturbations under various growth conditions. Thus, the model will be instrumental in guiding metabolic engineering of C. ljungdahlii for the industrial production of biocommodities and biofuels.","Harish Nagarajan, Merve Sahin, Juan Nogales, Haythem Latif, Derek R Lovley, Ali Ebrahim & Karsten Zengler.

iJN746,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas putida is the best studied pollutant degradative bacteria and is harnessed by industrial biotechnology to synthesize fine chemicals. Since the publication of P. putida KT2440's genome, some in silico analyses of its metabolic and biotechnology capacities have been published. However, global understanding of the capabilities of P. putida KT2440 requires the construction of a metabolic model that enables the integration of classical experimental data along with genomic and high-throughput data. The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) approach has been successfully used to build and analyze in silico genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. RESULTS: We present a genome-scale reconstruction of P. putida KT2440's metabolism, iJN746, which was constructed based on genomic, biochemical, and physiological information. This manually-curated reconstruction accounts for 746 genes, 950 reactions, and 911 metabolites. iJN746 captures biotechnologically relevant pathways, including polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis and catabolic pathways of aromatic compounds (e.g., toluene, benzoate, phenylacetate, nicotinate), not described in other metabolic reconstructions or biochemical databases. The predictive potential of iJN746 was validated using experimental data including growth performance and gene deletion studies. Furthermore, in silico growth on toluene was found to be oxygen-limited, suggesting the existence of oxygen-efficient pathways not yet annotated in P. putida's genome. Moreover, we evaluated the production efficiency of polyhydroxyalkanoates from various carbon sources and found fatty acids as the most prominent candidates, as expected. CONCLUSION: Here we presented the first genome-scale reconstruction of P. putida, a biotechnologically interesting all-surrounder. Taken together, this work illustrates the utility of iJN746 as i) a knowledge-base, ii) a discovery tool, and iii) an engineering platform to explore P. putida's potential in bioremediation and bioplastic production.","Juan Nogales, Bernhard Ø Palsson & Ines Thiele.

iJO1366,"The initial genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 was assembled in 2000. It has been updated and periodically released since then based on new and curated genomic and biochemical knowledge. An update has now been built, named iJO1366, which accounts for 1366 genes, 2251 metabolic reactions, and 1136 unique metabolites. iJO1366 was (1) updated in part using a new experimental screen of 1075 gene knockout strains, illuminating cases where alternative pathways and isozymes are yet to be discovered, (2) compared with its predecessor and to experimental data sets to confirm that it continues to make accurate phenotypic predictions of growth on different substrates and for gene knockout strains, and (3) mapped to the genomes of all available sequenced E. coli strains, including pathogens, leading to the identification of hundreds of unannotated genes in these organisms. Like its predecessors, the iJO1366 reconstruction is expected to be widely deployed for studying the systems biology of E. coli and for metabolic engineering applications.","Jeffrey D Orth, Tom M Conrad, Jessica Na, Joshua A Lerman, Hojung Nam, Adam M Feist & Bernhard Ø Palsson.

iJR904,"BACKGROUND: Diverse datasets, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data, are becoming readily available for specific organisms. There is currently a need to integrate these datasets within an in silico modeling framework. Constraint-based models of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 have been developed and used to study the bacterium's metabolism and phenotypic behavior. The most comprehensive E. coli model to date (E. coli iJE660a GSM) accounts for 660 genes and includes 627 unique biochemical reactions. RESULTS: An expanded genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (iJR904 GSM/GPR) has been reconstructed which includes 904 genes and 931 unique biochemical reactions. The reactions in the expanded model are both elementally and charge balanced. Network gap analysis led to putative assignments for 55 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene to protein to reaction associations (GPR) are now directly included in the model. Comparisons between predictions made by iJR904 and iJE660a models show that they are generally similar but differ under certain circumstances. Analysis of genome-scale proton balancing shows how the flux of protons into and out of the medium is important for maximizing cellular growth. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli iJR904 has improved capabilities over iJE660a. iJR904 is a more complete and chemically accurate description of E. coli metabolism than iJE660a. Perhaps most importantly, iJR904 can be used for analyzing and integrating the diverse datasets. iJR904 will help to outline the genotype-phenotype relationship for E. coli K-12, as it can account for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and fluxomic data simultaneously.","Jennifer L Reed, Thuy D Vo, Christophe H Schilling & Bernhard O Palsson.

iLJ478,"Metabolic pathways have traditionally been described in terms of biochemical reactions and metabolites. Using structural genomics and systems biology, we generated a three-dimensional reconstruction of the central metabolic network of the bacterium, Thermotoga maritima (TM). The network encompassed 478 proteins of which 120 were determined by experiment and 358 were modeled. Structural analysis revealed that proteins forming the network are dominated by a small number (only 182) of basic shapes (folds) performing diverse, but mostly related functions. Most of these folds are already present in the essential core (~30%) of the network, and its expansion by nonessential proteins is achieved with relatively few additional folds. Thus, integration of structural data with networks analysis generates insight into the function, mechanism and evolution of biological networks.","Ying Zhang, Ines Thiele, Dana Weekes, Zhanwen Li, Lukasz Jaroszewski, Krzysztof Ginalski, Ashley M.

iMM904,"BACKGROUND: Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool in the quantitative identification of physiological and disease-induced biological states. Extracellular metabolome or metabolic profiling data, in particular, can provide an insightful view of intracellular physiological states in a noninvasive manner. RESULTS: We used an updated genome-scale metabolic network model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, iMM904, to investigate how changes in the extracellular metabolome can be used to study systemic changes in intracellular metabolic states. The iMM904 metabolic network was reconstructed based on an existing genome-scale network, iND750, and includes 904 genes and 1,412 reactions. The network model was first validated by comparing 2,888 in silico single-gene deletion strain growth phenotype predictions to published experimental data. Extracellular metabolome data measured in response to environmental and genetic perturbations of ammonium assimilation pathways was then integrated with the iMM904 network in the form of relative overflow secretion constraints and a flux sampling approach was used to characterize candidate flux distributions allowed by these constraints. Predicted intracellular flux changes were consistent with published measurements on intracellular metabolite levels and fluxes. Patterns of predicted intracellular flux changes could also be used to correctly identify the regions of the metabolic network that were perturbed. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that integrating quantitative extracellular metabolomic profiles in a constraint-based framework enables inferring changes in intracellular metabolic flux states. Similar methods could potentially be applied towards analyzing biofluid metabolome variations related to human physiological and disease states.","Monica L Mo, Bernhard Ø Palsson & Markus J Herrgård.

iND750,"A fully compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that accounts for 750 genes and their associated transcripts, proteins, and reactions has been reconstructed and validated. All of the 1149 reactions included in this in silico model are both elementally and charge balanced and have been assigned to one of eight cellular locations (extracellular space, cytosol, mitochondrion, peroxisome, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or vacuole). When in silico predictions of 4154 growth phenotypes were compared to two published large-scale gene deletion studies, an 83% agreement was found between iND750's predictions and the experimental studies. Analysis of the failure modes showed that false predictions were primarily caused by iND750's limited inclusion of cellular processes outside of metabolism. This study systematically identified inconsistencies in our knowledge of yeast metabolism that require specific further experimental investigation.","Duarte NC, Herrgård MJ & Palsson BØ.

iNJ661,"BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to be a major pathogen in the third world, killing almost 2 million people a year by the most recent estimates. Even in industrialized countries, the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of tuberculosis hails the need to develop additional medications for treatment. Many of the drugs used for treatment of tuberculosis target metabolic enzymes. Genome-scale models can be used for analysis, discovery, and as hypothesis generating tools, which will hopefully assist the rational drug development process. These models need to be able to assimilate data from large datasets and analyze them. RESULTS: We completed a bottom up reconstruction of the metabolic network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. This functional in silico bacterium, iNJ661, contains 661 genes and 939 reactions and can produce many of the complex compounds characteristic to tuberculosis, such as mycolic acids and mycocerosates. We grew this bacterium in silico on various media, analyzed the model in the context of multiple high-throughput data sets, and finally we analyzed the network in an 'unbiased' manner by calculating the Hard Coupled Reaction (HCR) sets, groups of reactions that are forced to operate in unison due to mass conservation and connectivity constraints. CONCLUSION: Although we observed growth rates comparable to experimental observations (doubling times ranging from about 12 to 24 hours) in different media, comparisons of gene essentiality with experimental data were less encouraging (generally about 55%). The reasons for the often conflicting results were multi-fold, including gene expression variability under different conditions and lack of complete biological knowledge. Some of the inconsistencies between in vitro and in silico or in vivo and in silico results highlight specific loci that are worth further experimental investigations. Finally, by considering the HCR sets in the context of known drug targets for tuberculosis treatment we proposed new alternative, but equivalent drug targets.",Neema Jamshidi & Bernhard Ø Palsson.

iPC815,"BACKGROUND: Yersinia pestis is a gram-negative bacterium that causes plague, a disease linked historically to the Black Death in Europe during the Middle Ages and to several outbreaks during the modern era. Metabolism in Y. pestis displays remarkable flexibility and robustness, allowing the bacterium to proliferate in both warm-blooded mammalian hosts and cold-blooded insect vectors such as fleas. RESULTS: Here we report a genome-scale reconstruction and mathematical model of metabolism for Y. pestis CO92 and supporting experimental growth and metabolite measurements. The model contains 815 genes, 678 proteins, 963 unique metabolites and 1678 reactions, accurately simulates growth on a range of carbon sources both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identifies gaps in several key biosynthetic pathways and suggests how those gaps might be filled. Furthermore, our model presents hypotheses to explain certain known nutritional requirements characteristic of this strain. CONCLUSIONS: Y. pestis continues to be a dangerous threat to human health during modern times.

iSB619,"BACKGROUND: Several strains of bacteria have sequenced and annotated genomes, which have been used in conjunction with biochemical and physiological data to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic networks. Such reconstruction amounts to a two-dimensional annotation of the genome. These networks have been analyzed with a constraint-based formalism and a variety of biologically meaningful results have emerged. Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium that has evolved resistance to many antibiotics, representing a significant health care concern. We present the first manually curated elementally and charge balanced genome-scale reconstruction and model of S. aureus' metabolic networks and compute some of its properties. RESULTS: We reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic network of S. aureus strain N315. This reconstruction, termed iSB619, consists of 619 genes that catalyze 640 metabolic reactions. For 91% of the reactions, open reading frames are explicitly linked to proteins and to the reaction. All but three of the metabolic reactions are both charge and elementally balanced. The reaction list is the most complete to date for this pathogen. When the capabilities of the reconstructed network were analyzed in the context of maximal growth, we formed hypotheses regarding growth requirements, the efficiency of growth on different carbon sources, and potential drug targets. These hypotheses can be tested experimentally and the data gathered can be used to improve subsequent versions of the reconstruction. CONCLUSION: iSB619 represents comprehensive biochemically and genetically structured information about the metabolism of S. aureus to date.

STM_v1_0,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic reconstructions (MRs) are common denominators in systems biology and represent biochemical, genetic, and genomic (BiGG) knowledge-bases for target organisms by capturing currently available information in a consistent, structured manner. Salmonella enterica subspecies I serovar Typhimurium is a human pathogen, causes various diseases and its increasing antibiotic resistance poses a public health problem. RESULTS: Here, we describe a community-driven effort, in which more than 20 experts in S. Typhimurium biology and systems biology collaborated to reconcile and expand the S. Typhimurium BiGG knowledge-base. The consensus MR was obtained starting from two independently developed MRs for S. Typhimurium. Key results of this reconstruction jamboree include i) development and implementation of a community-based workflow for MR annotation and reconciliation; ii) incorporation of thermodynamic information; and iii) use of the consensus MR to identify potential multi-target drug therapy approaches. CONCLUSION: Taken together, with the growing number of parallel MRs a structured, community-driven approach will be necessary to maximize quality while increasing adoption of MRs in experimental design and interpretation.","Ines Thiele, Daniel R Hyduke, Benjamin Steeb, Guy Fankam, Douglas K Allen, Susanna Bazzani, Pep Charusanti, Feng-Chi Chen, Ronan MT Fleming, Chao A Hsiung, Sigrid CJ De Keersmaecker, Yu-Chieh Liao, Kathleen Marchal, Monica L Mo, Emre Özdemir, Anu Raghunathan, Jennifer L Reed, Sook-Il Shin, Sara Sigurbjörnsdóttir, Jonas Steinmann, Suresh Sudarsan, Neil Swainston, Inge M Thijs, Karsten Zengler, Bernhard O Palsson, Joshua N Adkins & Dirk Bumann.

iJN678,"Photosynthesis has recently gained considerable attention for its potential role in the development of renewable energy sources. Optimizing photosynthetic organisms for biomass or biofuel production will therefore require a systems understanding of photosynthetic processes. We reconstructed a high-quality genome-scale metabolic network for Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 that describes key photosynthetic processes in mechanistic detail. We performed an exhaustive in silico analysis of the reconstructed photosynthetic process under different light and inorganic carbon (Ci) conditions as well as under genetic perturbations. Our key results include the following. (i) We identified two main states of the photosynthetic apparatus: a Ci-limited state and a light-limited state. (ii) We discovered nine alternative electron flow pathways that assist the photosynthetic linear electron flow in optimizing the photosynthesis performance. (iii) A high degree of cooperativity between alternative pathways was found to be critical for optimal autotrophic metabolism. Although pathways with high photosynthetic yield exist for optimizing growth under suboptimal light conditions, pathways with low photosynthetic yield guarantee optimal growth under excessive light or Ci limitation. (iv) Photorespiration was found to be essential for the optimal photosynthetic process, clarifying its role in high-light acclimation. Finally, (v) an extremely high photosynthetic robustness drives the optimal autotrophic metabolism at the expense of metabolic versatility and robustness. The results and modeling approach presented here may promote a better understanding of the photosynthetic process. They can also guide bioengineering projects toward optimal biofuel production in photosynthetic organisms.","J. Nogales, S. Gudmundsson, E. M. Knight, B. O. Palsson & I. Thiele.

modeldb-57910,"1. The regular firing of a Hodgkin-Huxley neurone endowed with fast Na+ and delayed K+ channels can be converted into adapting firing by appending HERG (human eag-related gene) channels. 2. The computer model predictions were verified by studying the firing properties of F-11 DRG neurone x neuroblastoma hybrid cells induced to differentiate by long-term exposure to retinoic acid. These cells, which express HERG currents (IHERG), show clear spike-frequency adaptation of their firing when current clamped with long depolarizations. 3. In agreement with the prediction, the selective blocking of IHERG by class III antiarrhythmic drugs always led to the disappearance of the spike-frequency adaptation, and the conversion of adapting firing to regular firing. 4. It is proposed that, in addition to their role in the repolarization of the heart action potential, HERG channels may sustain a process of spike-frequency adaptation, and hence contribute to the control of burst duration in a way that is similar to that of the K+ currents, IAHP, IC and IM. In addition to the known cardiac arrhythmia syndrome (LQT2), genetic mutations or an altered HERG expression could lead to continuous hyperexcitable states sustained by the inability of nerve or endocrine cells to accommodate to repetitive stimuli. This might help in clarifying the pathogenesis of still undefined idiopathic familial epilepsies.","Nicoletta Chiesa, Barbara Rosati, Annarosa Arcangeli, Massimo Olivotto & Enzo Wanke.

The paper describes a computational model that simulates the electrical activity of neurons in a simplified neural network that controls rhythmic motor activity. The authors focus on the activity phase of the postsynaptic neurons, which is the period of time during which the neuron is most responsive to input signals from other neurons. They show that the activity phase can be modulated by changing the strength of synaptic connections between the neurons, and that this modulation can affect the frequency and amplitude of the rhythmic activity. The results suggest that this computational model could be useful for studying the mechanisms underlying rhythmic motor control in more complex neural networks.","Amitabha Bose, Yair Manor & Farzan Nadim.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We develop a detailed Markov model of I(Ks) and its α-subunit KCNQ1 and examine their kinetic properties during the cardiac ventricular action potential at different rates. We observe that interaction between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (the β-subunit) confers kinetic properties on I(Ks) that make it suitable for participation in action potential repolarization and its adaptation to rate changes; in particular, the channel develops an available reserve of closed states near the open state that can open rapidly on demand. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its ability to form an available reserve, I(Ks) can function as a repolarization reserve when I(Kr), the rapid delayed rectifier, is reduced by disease or drug and can prevent excessive action potential prolongation and development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations.","Jonathan Silva & Yoram Rudy.

A recent example is a single mutation in the C terminus of the cardiac Na(+) channel, 1795insD. The mutation causes two distinct clinical syndromes, long QT (LQT) and Brugada, leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate. We develop Markov models of the wild-type and 1795insD cardiac Na(+) channels. By incorporating the models into a virtual transgenic cell, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1795insD differentially disrupts cellular electrical behavior in epicardial and midmyocardial cell types. We provide a cellular mechanistic basis for the ECG abnormalities observed in patients carrying the 1795insD gene mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation can cause both LQT and Brugada syndromes through interaction with the heterogeneous myocardium in a rate-dependent manner. The results highlight the complexity and multiplicity of genotype-phenotype relationships, and the usefulness of computational approaches in establishing a mechanistic link between genetic defects and functional abnormalities.","Colleen E.

modeldb-111877,"The gating kinetics of a Ca2+-activated K+ channel from adult rat muscle plasma membrane are studied in artificial planar bilayers. Analysis of single-channel fluctuations distinguishes two Ca2+- and voltage-dependent processes: (a) short-lived channel closure (less than 1 ms) events appearing in a bursting pattern; (b) opening and closing events ranging from one to several hundred milliseconds in duration. The latter process is studied independently of the first and is denoted as the primary gating mode. At constant voltage, the mean open time of the primary gating mode is a linear function of the [Ca2+], whereas the mean closed time is a linear function of the reciprocal [Ca2+]. In the limits of zero and infinite [Ca2+], the mean open and the mean closed times are, respectively, independent of voltage. These results are predicted by a kinetic scheme consisting of the following reaction steps: (a) binding of Ca2+ to a closed state; (b) channel opening; (c) binding of a second Ca2+ ion. In this scheme, the two Ca2+ binding reactions are voltage dependent, whereas the open-closed transition is voltage independent. The kinetic constant derived for this scheme gives an accurate theoretical fit to the observed equilibrium open-state probability.

A recent study using in situ perfused rat brain preparations demonstrated a reorganization of the respiratory pattern with sequential reduction of the brain stem respiratory network. Specifically, with removal of the pons, the normal three-phase pattern transformed to a two-phase inspiratory–expiratory pattern and, with more caudal transections, to one-phase, intrinsically generated inspiratory oscillations. A minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically participates in the expiratory–inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast–slow decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that, although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst generation. Our results provide important insights for understanding the state-dependent mechanisms for respiratory rhythm generation and control.","Jonathan E. Rubin, Natalia A. Shevtsova, G.

Experimental evidence has shown that such dynamics are highly variable between different trials, cells, and cell subcompartments. Here we present a qualitative analysis of a recent mathematical model of astrocyte calcium responses. We show how the major response types are generated in the model as a result of the underlying bifurcation structure. By varying key channel parameters, mimicking blockers used by experimentalists, we manipulate this underlying bifurcation structure and predict how the distributions of responses can change. We find that store-operated calcium channels, plasma membrane bound channels with little activity during calcium transients, have a surprisingly strong effect, underscoring the importance of considering these channels in both experiments and mathematical settings. Variation in the maximum flow in different calcium channels is also shown to determine the range of stable oscillations, as well as set the range of frequencies of the oscillations. Further, by conducting a randomized search through the parameter space and recording the resulting calcium responses, we create a database that can be used by experimentalists to help estimate the underlying channel distribution of their cells.","Gregory Handy, Marsa Taheri, John A.

modeldb-143072,"Neurons rely on action potentials, or spikes, to relay information. Pathological changes in spike generation likely contribute to certain enigmatic features of neurological disease, like paroxysmal attacks of pain and muscle spasm. Paroxysmal symptoms are characterized by abrupt onset and short duration, and are associated with abnormal spiking although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. To help decipher the biophysical basis for ‘paroxysmal’ spiking, we replicated afterdischarge (i.e. continued spiking after a brief stimulus) in a minimal conductance-based axon model. We then applied nonlinear dynamical analysis to explain the dynamical basis for initiation and termination of afterdischarge. A perturbation could abruptly switch the system between two (quasi-)stable attractor states: rest and repetitive spiking. This bistability was a consequence of slow positive feedback mediated by persistent inward current. Initiation of afterdischarge was explained by activation of the persistent inward current forcing the system to cross a saddle point that separates the basins of attraction associated with each attractor. Termination of afterdischarge was explained by the attractor associated with repetitive spiking being destroyed. This occurred when ultra-slow negative feedback, such as intracellular sodium accumulation, caused the saddle point and stable limit cycle to collide; in that regard, the active attractor is not truly stable when the slowest dynamics are taken into account. The model also explains other features of paroxysmal symptoms, including temporal summation and refractoriness.","Jay S Coggan, Gabriel K Ocker, Terrence J Sejnowski & Steven A Prescott.

modeldb-206380,"In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), interactions between dopamine (DA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons are critical for regulating DA neuron activity and thus DA efflux. To provide a mechanistic explanation of how GABA neurons influence DA neuron firing, we developed a circuit model of the VTA. The model is based on feed-forward inhibition and recreates canonical features of the VTA neurons. Simulations revealed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (GABAR) stimulation can differentially influence the firing pattern of the DA neuron, depending on the level of synchronization among GABA neurons. Asynchronous activity of GABA neurons provides a constant level of inhibition to the DA neuron and, when removed, produces a classical disinhibition burst. In contrast, when GABA neurons are synchronized by common synaptic input, their influence evokes additional spikes in the DA neuron, resulting in increased measures of firing and bursting. Distinct from previous mechanisms, the increases were not based on lowered firing rate of the GABA neurons or weaker hyperpolarization by the GABAR synaptic current. This phenomenon was induced by GABA-mediated hyperpolarization of the DA neuron that leads to decreases in intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration, thus reducing the Ca(2+)-dependent potassium (K(+)) current. In this way, the GABA-mediated hyperpolarization replaces Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) current; however, this inhibition is pulsatile, which allows the DA neuron to fire during the rhythmic pauses in inhibition. Our results emphasize the importance of inhibition in the VTA, which has been discussed in many studies, and suggest a novel mechanism whereby computations can occur locally.","Ekaterina O.

modeldb-58195,"Activation of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels is controlled by both cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and membrane potential. To study the mechanism of voltage-dependent gating, we examined mSlo Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents in excised macropatches from Xenopus oocytes in the virtual absence of Ca(2+) (<1 nM). In response to a voltage step, I(K) activates with an exponential time course, following a brief delay. The delay suggests that rapid transitions precede channel opening. The later exponential time course suggests that activation also involves a slower rate-limiting step. However, the time constant of I(K) relaxation [τ(I(K))] exhibits a complex voltage dependence that is inconsistent with models that contain a single rate limiting step. τ(I(K)) increases weakly with voltage from −500 to −20 mV, with an equivalent charge (z) of only 0.14 e, and displays a stronger voltage dependence from +30 to +140 mV (z = 0.49 e), which then decreases from +180 to +240 mV (z = −0.29 e). Similarly, the steady state G(K)–V relationship exhibits a maximum voltage dependence (z = 2 e) from 0 to +100 mV, and is weakly voltage dependent (z ≅ 0.4 e) at more negative voltages, where P (o) = 10(−5)–10(−6). These results can be understood in terms of a gating scheme where a central transition between a closed and an open conformation is allosterically regulated by the state of four independent and identical voltage sensors. In the absence of Ca(2+), this allosteric mechanism results in a gating scheme with five closed (C) and five open (O) states, where the majority of the channel's voltage dependence results from rapid C–C and O–O transitions, whereas the C–O transitions are rate limiting and weakly voltage dependent. These conclusions not only provide a framework for interpreting studies of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel voltage gating, but also have important implications for understanding the mechanism of Ca(2+) sensitivity.","Frank T.

During the acute-stage of spinal cord injury (SCI), the endogenous ability to generate plateaus is lost; however, during the chronic-stage of SCI, plateau potentials reappear with prolonged self-sustained firing that has been implicated in the development of spasticity. In this work, we extend previous modeling studies to systematically investigate the mechanisms underlying the generation of plateau potentials in motoneurons, including the influences of specific ionic currents, the morphological characteristics of the soma and dendrite, and the interactions between persistent inward currents and synaptic input. In particular, the goal of these computational studies is to explore the possible interactions between morphological and electrophysiological changes that occur after incomplete SCI. Model results predict that some of the morphological changes generally associated with the chronic-stage for some types of spinal cord injuries can cause a decrease in self-sustained firing. This and other computational results presented here suggest that the observed increases in self-sustained firing following some types of SCI may occur mainly due to changes in membrane conductances and changes in synaptic activity, particularly changes in the strength and timing of inhibition.","Mini Kurian, Sharon M.

modeldb-116123,"Transduction of graded synaptic input into trains of all-or-none action potentials (spikes) is a crucial step in neural coding. Hodgkin identified three classes of neurons with qualitatively different analog-to-digital transduction properties. Despite widespread use of this classification scheme, a generalizable explanation of its biophysical basis has not been described. We recorded from spinal sensory neurons representing each class and reproduced their transduction properties in a minimal model. With phase plane and bifurcation analysis, each class of excitability was shown to derive from distinct spike initiating dynamics. Excitability could be converted between all three classes by varying single parameters; moreover, several parameters, when varied one at a time, had functionally equivalent effects on excitability. From this, we conclude that the spike-initiating dynamics associated with each of Hodgkin's classes represent different outcomes in a nonlinear competition between oppositely directed, kinetically mismatched currents. Class 1 excitability occurs through a saddle node on invariant circle bifurcation when net current at perithreshold potentials is inward (depolarizing) at steady state. Class 2 excitability occurs through a Hopf bifurcation when, despite net current being outward (hyperpolarizing) at steady state, spike initiation occurs because inward current activates faster than outward current. Class 3 excitability occurs through a quasi-separatrix crossing when fast-activating inward current overpowers slow-activating outward current during a stimulus transient, although slow-activating outward current dominates during constant stimulation. Experiments confirmed that different classes of spinal lamina I neurons express the subthreshold currents predicted by our simulations and, further, that those currents are necessary for the excitability in each cell class. Thus, our results demonstrate that all three classes of excitability arise from a continuum in the direction and magnitude of subthreshold currents.

modeldb-116386,"During wakefulness, pyramidal neurons in the intact brain are bombarded by synaptic input that causes tonic depolarization, increased membrane conductance (i.e., shunting), and noisy fluctuations in membrane potential; by comparison, pyramidal neurons in acute slices typically experience little background input. Such differences in operating conditions can compromise extrapolation of in vitro data to explain neuronal operation in vivo. For instance, pyramidal neurons have been identified as integrators (i.e., class 1 neurons according to Hodgkin's classification of intrinsic excitability) based on in vitro experiments but that classification is inconsistent with the ability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to oscillate/resonate at theta frequency since intrinsic oscillatory behavior is limited to class 2 neurons. Using long depolarizing stimuli and dynamic clamp to reproduce in vivo-like conditions in slice experiments, we show that CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells switch from integrators to resonators, i.e., from class 1 to class 2 excitability. The switch is explained by increased outward current contributed by the M-type potassium current I(M), which shifts the balance of inward and outward currents active at perithreshold potentials and thereby converts the spike-initiating mechanism as predicted by dynamical analysis of our computational model. Perithreshold activation of I(M) is enhanced by the depolarizing shift in spike threshold caused by shunting and/or sodium channel inactivation secondary to tonic depolarization. Our conclusions were validated by multiple comparisons between simulation and experimental data.

They have complex internal dynamics, which allow them to fire spontaneously, display bistability, and also to be involved in network phenomena such as high frequency oscillations and travelling waves. Purkinje cells exhibit type II excitability, which can be revealed by a discontinuity in their f-I curves. We show that this excitability mechanism allows Purkinje cells to be efficiently inhibited by noise of a particular variance, a phenomenon known as inverse stochastic resonance (ISR). While ISR has been described in theoretical models of single neurons, here we provide the first experimental evidence for this effect. We find that an adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model fitted to the basic Purkinje cell characteristics using a modified dynamic IV method displays ISR and bistability between the resting state and a repetitive activity limit cycle. ISR allows the Purkinje cell to operate in different functional regimes: the all-or-none toggle or the linear filter mode, depending on the variance of the synaptic input. We propose that synaptic noise allows Purkinje cells to quickly switch between these functional regimes.

Using a biophysically based model, we demonstrate here that the typical absence seizure activities can be controlled and modulated by the direct GABAergic projections from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to either the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) or the specific relay nuclei (SRN) of thalamus, through different biophysical mechanisms. Under certain conditions, these two types of seizure control are observed to coexist in the same network.

The paper explores the effects of rotenone, a widely-used inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory chain, on various aspects of hippocampal neuron activity in mice. The study found that rotenone affects several key ionic currents and the spontaneous release of neurotransmitters in these cells, potentially impacting their overall function and communication patterns.

modeldb-247694,"Astrocytes, a glial cell type of the central nervous system, have emerged as detectors and regulators of neuronal information processing. Astrocyte excitability resides in transient variations of free cytosolic calcium concentration over a range of temporal and spatial scales, from sub-microdomains to waves propagating throughout the cell. Despite extensive experimental approaches, it is not clear how these signals are transmitted to and integrated within an astrocyte. The localization of the main molecular actors and the geometry of the system, including the spatial organization of calcium channels IP(3)R, are deemed essential. However, as most calcium signals occur in astrocytic ramifications that are too fine to be resolved by conventional light microscopy, most of those spatial data are unknown and computational modeling remains the only methodology to study this issue. Here, we propose an IP(3)R-mediated calcium signaling model for dynamics in such small sub-cellular volumes. To account for the expected stochasticity and low copy numbers, our model is both spatially explicit and particle-based. Extensive simulations show that spontaneous calcium signals arise in the model via the interplay between excitability and stochasticity. The model reproduces the main forms of calcium signals and indicates that their frequency crucially depends on the spatial organization of the IP(3)R channels. Importantly, we show that two processes expressing exactly the same calcium channels can display different types of calcium signals depending on the spatial organization of the channels. Our model with realistic process volume and calcium concentrations successfully reproduces spontaneous calcium signals that we measured in calcium micro-domains with confocal microscopy and predicts that local variations of calcium indicators might contribute to the diversity of calcium signals observed in astrocytes. To our knowledge, this model is the first model suited to investigate calcium dynamics in fine astrocytic processes and to propose plausible mechanisms responsible for their variability.","Audrey Denizot, Misa Arizono, U.

modeldb-256627,"Neuropathic pain remains notoriously difficult to treat despite numerous drug targets. Here, we offer a novel explanation for this intractability. Computer simulations predicted that qualitative changes in primary afferent excitability linked to neuropathic pain arise through a switch in spike initiation dynamics when molecular pathologies reach a tipping point (criticality), and that this tipping point can be reached via several different molecular pathologies (degeneracy). We experimentally tested these predictions by pharmacologically blocking native conductances and/or electrophysiologically inserting virtual conductances. Multiple different manipulations successfully reproduced or reversed neuropathic changes in primary afferents from naïve or nerve-injured rats, respectively, thus confirming the predicted criticality and its degenerate basis. Degeneracy means that several different molecular pathologies are individually sufficient to cause hyperexcitability, and because several such pathologies co-occur after nerve injury, that no single pathology is uniquely necessary. Consequently, single-target-drugs can be circumvented by maladaptive plasticity in any one of several ion channels.

The research paper suggests that the large extracellular space in the brain can make neurons vulnerable to ischemic injury, which is a type of damage caused by reduced oxygen and nutrient supply. This vulnerability is due to the dependence of neurons on Na+/K+ pumps, which are hindered when there is a reduced energy supply. The study used computer simulations to predict how changes in the extracellular space affect neuronal activity and found that reducing the extracellular space is a potential strategy for protecting neurons from ischemic injury.","Niklas Hübel, R.

modeldb-167714,"The classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model neglects the time-dependence of ion concentrations in spiking dynamics. The dynamics is therefore limited to a time scale of milliseconds, which is determined by the membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the gating time constants. We study slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that includes time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. Ion gain and loss of the system is identified as a bifurcation parameter whose essential importance was not realized in earlier studies. Our systematic study of the bifurcation structure and thus the phase space structure helps to understand activation and inhibition of a new excitability in ion homeostasis which emerges in such extended models. Also modulatory mechanisms that regulate the spiking rate can be explained by bifurcations. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.","Niklas Hübel & Markus A.

modeldb-152028,"Studying ion channel currents generated distally from the recording site is difficult because of artifacts caused by poor space clamp and membrane filtering. A computational model can quantify artifact parameters for correction by simulating the currents only if their exact anatomical location is known. We propose that the same artifacts that confound current recordings can help pinpoint the source of those currents by providing a signature of the neuron’s morphology. This method can improve the recording quality of currents initiated at the spike initiation zone (SIZ) that are often distal to the soma in invertebrate neurons. Drosophila being a valuable tool for characterizing ion currents, we estimated the SIZ location and quantified artifacts in an identified motoneuron, aCC/MN1-Ib, by constructing a novel multicompartmental model. Initial simulation of the measured biophysical channel properties in an isopotential Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model partially replicated firing characteristics. Adding a second distal compartment, which contained spike-generating Na(+) and K(+) currents, was sufficient to simulate aCC’s in vivo activity signature. Matching this signature using a reconstructed morphology predicted that the SIZ is on aCC’s primary axon, 70 μm after the most distal dendritic branching point. From SIZ to soma, we observed and quantified selective morphological filtering of fast activating currents. Non-inactivating K(+) currents are filtered ∼3 times less and despite their large magnitude at the soma they could be as distal as Na(+) currents. The peak of transient component (NaT) of the voltage-activated Na(+) current is also filtered more than the magnitude of slower persistent component (NaP), which can contribute to seizures. The corrected NaP/NaT ratio explains the previously observed discrepancy when the same channel is expressed in different cells. In summary, we used an in vivo signature to estimate ion channel location and recording artifacts, which can be applied to other neurons.","Cengiz Günay, Fred H.

modeldb-114452,"The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in the induction of long-term postsynaptic modifications following calcium entry. Experiments suggest that these long-term synaptic changes are all-or-none switch-like events between discrete states. The biochemical network involving CaMKII and its regulating protein signaling cascade has been hypothesized to durably maintain the evoked synaptic state in the form of a bistable switch. However, it is still unclear whether experimental LTP/LTD protocols lead to corresponding transitions between the two states in realistic models of such a network. We present a detailed biochemical model of the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the CaMKII dephosphorylation. As previously shown, two stable states of the CaMKII phosphorylation level exist at resting intracellular calcium concentration, and high calcium transients can switch the system from the weakly phosphorylated (DOWN) to the highly phosphorylated (UP) state of the CaMKII (similar to a LTP event). We show here that increased CaMKII dephosphorylation activity at intermediate Ca(2+) concentrations can lead to switching from the UP to the DOWN state (similar to a LTD event). This can be achieved if protein phosphatase activity promoting CaMKII dephosphorylation activates at lower Ca(2+) levels than kinase activity. Finally, it is shown that the CaMKII system can qualitatively reproduce results of plasticity outcomes in response to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and presynaptic stimulation protocols. This shows that the CaMKII protein network can account for both induction, through LTP/LTD-like transitions, and storage, due to its bistability, of synaptic changes.","Michael Graupner & Nicolas Brunel.

This nucleus is more than a simple relay, however, because rNST neurons differ in response rates and tuning curves relative to primary afferent fibers. To systematically study the impact of convergence and inhibition on firing frequency and breadth of tuning (BOT) in rNST, we constructed a mathematical model of its two major cell types: projection neurons and inhibitory neurons. First, we fit a conductance-based neuronal model to data derived from whole cell patch-clamp recordings of inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons in a mouse expressing Venus under the control of the VGAT promoter. We then used in vivo chorda tympani (CT) taste responses as afferent input to modeled neurons and assessed how the degree and type of convergence influenced model cell output frequency and BOT for comparison with in vivo gustatory responses from the rNST. Finally, we assessed how presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition impacted model cell output. The results of our simulations demonstrated 1) increasing numbers of convergent afferents (2–10) result in a proportional increase in best-stimulus firing frequency but only a modest increase in BOT, 2) convergence of afferent input selected from the same best-stimulus class of CT afferents produced a better fit to real data from the rNST compared with convergence of randomly selected afferent input, and 3) inhibition narrowed the BOT to more realistically model the in vivo rNST data.

A complete understanding of pathological conditions as well as normal brain function, therefore, hinges on elucidating the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these mostly interdependent variations. In this paper, we develop the first computational framework that combines the Hodgkin–Huxley type spiking dynamics, dynamic ion concentrations and glutamate homeostasis, neuronal and astroglial volume changes, and ion exchange with vasculature into a comprehensive model to elucidate the role of glutamate uptake in the dynamics of spreading depolarization (SD)—the electrophysiological event underlying numerous pathologies including migraine, ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hematoma, and trauma. We are particularly interested in investigating the role of glutamate in the duration and termination of SD caused by K(+) perfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results demonstrate that glutamate signaling plays a key role in the dynamics of SD, and that impaired glutamate uptake leads to recovery failure of neurons from SD. We confirm predictions from our model experimentally by showing that inhibiting astrocytic glutamate uptake using TFB-TBOA nearly quadruples the duration of SD in layers 2-3 of visual cortical slices from juvenile rats. The model equations are either derived purely from first physical principles of electroneutrality, osmosis, and conservation of particles or a combination of these principles and known physiological facts.

SCI-induced spasticity has been associated with motoneuron hyperexcitability partly due to enhanced activation of intrinsic persistent inward currents (PICs). Disrupted spinal inhibitory mechanisms also have been implicated. Altered inhibition can result from complex changes in the strength, kinetics, and reversal potential (E(Cl(−))) of γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) and glycine receptor currents. Development of optimal therapeutic strategies requires an understanding of the impact of these interacting factors on motoneuron excitability. We employed computational methods to study the effects of conductance, kinetics, and E(Cl(−)) of a dendritic inhibition on PIC activation and motoneuron discharge. A two-compartment motoneuron with enhanced PICs characteristic of SCI and receiving recurrent inhibition from Renshaw cells was utilized in these simulations. This dendritic inhibition regulated PIC onset and offset and exerted its strongest effects at motoneuron recruitment and in the secondary range of the current-frequency relationship during PIC activation. Increasing inhibitory conductance compensated for moderate depolarizing shifts in E(Cl(−)) by limiting PIC activation and self-sustained firing. Furthermore, GABA(A) currents exerted greater control on PIC activation than glycinergic currents, an effect attributable to their slower kinetics.

Three reduced computational models that simulate eupnoeic and vagotomized respiratory rhythms are considered. All models exhibit the emergence of respiratory perturbations associated with Rett syndrome as inhibition to the KFn is diminished. Simulations suggest that application of 5‐HT(1A) agonists can mitigate the respiratory pathology. The three models can be distinguished and tested based on their predictions about connections and dynamics within the respiratory circuit and about effects of perturbations on certain respiratory neuron populations. ABSTRACT: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a developmental disorder that can lead to respiratory disturbances featuring prolonged apnoeas of variable durations. Determining the mechanisms underlying these effects at the level of respiratory neural circuits would have significant implications for treatment efforts and would also enhance our understanding of respiratory rhythm generation and control. While experimental studies have suggested possible factors contributing to the respiratory patterns of RTT, we take a novel computational approach to the investigation of RTT, which allows for direct manipulation of selected system parameters and testing of specific hypotheses. Specifically, we present three reduced computational models, developed using an established framework, all of which successfully simulate respiratory outputs across eupnoeic and vagotomized conditions. All three models show that loss of inhibition to the Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus reproduces the key respiratory alterations associated with RTT and, as suggested experimentally, that effects of 5‐HT(1A) agonists on the respiratory neural circuit suffice to alleviate this respiratory pathology. Each of the models makes distinct predictions regarding the neuronal populations and interactions underlying these effects, suggesting natural directions for future experimental testing.","Samuel Wittman, Ana Paula Abdala & Jonathan E.

modeldb-227577,"In the basal ganglia, focused rhythmicity is an important feature of network activity at certain stages of motor processing. In disease, however, the basal ganglia develop amplified rhythmicity. Here, we demonstrate how the cellular architecture and network dynamics of an inhibitory loop in the basal ganglia yield exaggerated synchrony and locking to β oscillations, specifically in the dopamine-depleted state. A key component of this loop is the pallidostriatal pathway, a well-characterized anatomical projection whose function has long remained obscure. We present a synaptic characterization of this pathway in mice and incorporate these data into a computational model that we use to investigate its influence over striatal activity under simulated healthy and dopamine-depleted conditions. Our model predicts that the pallidostriatal pathway influences striatal output preferentially during periods of synchronized activity within GPe. We show that, under dopamine-depleted conditions, this effect becomes a key component of a positive feedback loop between the GPe and striatum that promotes synchronization and rhythmicity. Our results generate novel predictions about the role of the pallidostriatal pathway in shaping basal ganglia activity in health and disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This work demonstrates that functional connections from the globus pallidus externa (GPe) to striatum are substantially stronger onto fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) than onto medium spiny neurons. Our circuit model suggests that when GPe spikes are synchronous, this pallidostriatal pathway causes synchronous FSI activity pauses, which allow a transient window of disinhibition for medium spiny neurons. In simulated dopamine-depletion, this GPe-FSI activity is necessary for the emergence of strong synchronization and the amplification and propagation of β oscillations, which are a hallmark of parkinsonian circuit dysfunction. These results suggest that GPe may play a central role in propagating abnormal circuit activity to striatum, which in turn projects to downstream basal ganglia structures. These findings warrant further exploration of GPe as a target for interventions for Parkinson's disease.","V. L. Corbit, T. C. Whalen, K. T. Zitelli, S. Y. Crilly, J. E. Rubin & A. H. Gittis.

modeldb-206365,"Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition in which a basal brain hyperexcitability results in paroxysmal hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. Human temporal lobe epilepsy has been associated with dysfunction or loss of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 in a subset of pyramidal cells in the subiculum, a key structure generating epileptic activities. KCC2 regulates intraneuronal chloride and extracellular potassium levels by extruding both ions. Absence of effective KCC2 may alter the dynamics of chloride and potassium levels during repeated activation of GABAergic synapses due to interneuron activity. In turn, such GABAergic stress may itself affect Cl(−) regulation. Such changes in ionic homeostasis may switch GABAergic signaling from inhibitory to excitatory in affected pyramidal cells and also increase neuronal excitability. Possibly these changes contribute to periodic bursting in pyramidal cells, an essential component in the onset of ictal epileptic events. We tested this hypothesis with a computational model of a subicular network with realistic connectivity. The pyramidal cell model explicitly incorporated the cotransporter KCC2 and its effects on the internal/external chloride and potassium levels. Our network model suggested the loss of KCC2 in a critical number of pyramidal cells increased external potassium and intracellular chloride concentrations leading to seizure-like field potential oscillations. These oscillations included transient discharges leading to ictal-like field events with frequency spectra as in vitro. Restoration of KCC2 function suppressed seizure activity and thus may present a useful therapeutic option. These simulations therefore suggest that reduced KCC2 cotransporter activity alone may underlie the generation of ictal discharges. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ion regulation in the brain is a major determinant of neural excitability. Intracellular chloride in neurons, a partial determinant of the resting potential and the inhibitory reversal potentials, is regulated together with extracellular potassium via kation chloride cotransporters. During temporal lobe epilepsy, the homeostatic regulation of intracellular chloride is impaired in pyramidal cells, yet how this dysregulation may lead to seizures has not been explored. Using a realistic neural network model describing ion mechanisms, we show that chloride homeostasis pathology provokes seizure activity analogous to recordings from epileptogenic brain tissue. We show that there is a critical percentage of pathological cells required for seizure initiation. Our model predicts that restoration of the chloride homeostasis in pyramidal cells could be a viable antiepileptic strategy.","Anatoly Buchin, Anton Chizhov, Gilles Huberfeld, Richard Miles & Boris S.

modeldb-190261,"Pain caused by nerve injury (i.e. neuropathic pain) is associated with development of neuronal hyperexcitability at several points along the pain pathway. Within primary afferents, numerous injury-induced changes have been identified but it remains unclear which molecular changes are necessary and sufficient to explain cellular hyperexcitability. To investigate this, we built computational models that reproduce the switch from a normal spiking pattern characterized by a single spike at the onset of depolarization to a neuropathic one characterized by repetitive spiking throughout depolarization. Parameter changes that were sufficient to switch the spiking pattern also enabled membrane potential oscillations and bursting, suggesting that all three pathological changes are mechanistically linked. Dynamical analysis confirmed this prediction by showing that excitability changes co-develop when the nonlinear mechanism responsible for spike initiation switches from a quasi-separatrix-crossing to a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. This switch stems from biophysical changes that bias competition between oppositely directed fast- and slow-activating conductances operating at subthreshold potentials. Competition between activation and inactivation of a single conductance can be similarly biased with equivalent consequences for excitability. “Bias” can arise from a multitude of molecular changes occurring alone or in combination; in the latter case, changes can add or offset one another. Thus, our results identify pathological change in the nonlinear interaction between processes affecting spike initiation as the critical determinant of how simple injury-induced changes at the molecular level manifest complex excitability changes at the cellular level. We demonstrate that multiple distinct molecular changes are sufficient to produce neuropathic changes in excitability; however, given that nerve injury elicits numerous molecular changes that may be individually sufficient to alter spike initiation, our results argue that no single molecular change is necessary to produce neuropathic excitability. This deeper understanding of degenerate causal relationships has important implications for how we understand and treat neuropathic pain.","Young-Ah Rho & Steven A. Prescott.

The paper is a computational study that investigates how the localization of persistent inward current (PIC), an electrical property of dendrites that contributes to motor neuron excitability, affects the input-output properties of spinal motoneuron pools. The study found that altering the location and distribution of PIC within dendrites can significantly impact the output of the motoneuron pool, indicating that PIC localization plays a crucial role in shaping motor neuron excitability and output. The findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying motor control and for the development of targeted therapies for motor control disorders.","Hojeong Kim.

modeldb-255569,"Continuation of spiking after a stimulus ends (i.e. persistent spiking) is thought to support working memory. Muscarinic receptor activation enables persistent spiking among synaptically isolated pyramidal neurons in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but a detailed characterization of that spiking is lacking and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the rate of persistent spiking in ACC neurons is insensitive to the intensity and number of triggers, but can be modulated by injected current, and that persistent spiking can resume after several seconds of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging in brain slices from male rats, we determined that canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are necessary for persistent spiking and that TRPC-activating calcium enters in a spike-dependent manner via voltage-gated calcium channels. Constrained by these biophysical details, we built a computational model that reproduced the observed pattern of persistent spiking. Nonlinear dynamical analysis of that model revealed that TRPC channels become fully activated by the small rise in intracellular calcium caused by evoked spikes. Calcium continues to rise during persistent spiking, but because TRPC channel activation saturates, firing rate stabilizes. By calcium rising higher than required for maximal TRPC channel activation, TRPC channels are able to remain active during periods of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence (until calcium drops below saturating levels) such that persistent spiking can resume when hyperpolarization is discontinued. Our results thus reveal that the robust intrinsic bistability exhibited by ACC neurons emerges from the nonlinear positive feedback relationship between spike-dependent calcium influx and TRPC channel activation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons use action potentials, or spikes, to encode information. Some neurons can store information for short periods (seconds to minutes) by continuing to spike after a stimulus ends, thus enabling working memory. This so-called “persistent” spiking occurs in many brain areas and has been linked to activation of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. However, TRPC activation alone is insufficient to explain many aspects of persistent spiking such as resumption of spiking after periods of imposed quiescence. Using experiments and simulations, we show that calcium influx caused by spiking is necessary and sufficient to activate TRPC channels and that the ensuing positive feedback interaction between intracellular calcium and TRPC channel activation can account for many hitherto unexplained aspects of persistent spiking.","Stéphanie Ratté, Sergei Karnup & Steven A.

The debate on this issue has occurred in parallel to investigations of interactions among respiratory network neurons and how these contribute to respiratory behavior. In this computational study, we demonstrate how these two issues are inextricably linked. We use simulations and dynamical systems analysis to show that once a conditional respiratory pacemaker, which can be tuned across oscillatory and non-oscillatory dynamic regimes in isolation, is embedded into a respiratory network, its dynamics become masked: the network exhibits similar dynamical properties regardless of the conditional pacemaker node’s tuning, and that node’s outputs are dominated by network influences. Furthermore, the outputs of the respiratory central pattern generator as a whole are invariant to these changes of dynamical properties, which ensures flexible and robust performance over a wide dynamic range.","Jonathan E.

However, their modulatory actions on different types of ionic currents in electrically excitable cells remain largely unresolved. The present experiments were undertaken to explore the possible perturbations of SSM and SesA on different types of ionic currents, e.g., voltage-gated Na(+) currents (I(Na)), erg-mediated K(+) currents (I(K(erg))), M-type K(+) currents (I(K(M))), delayed-rectifier K(+) currents (I(K(DR))) and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (I(h)) identified from pituitary tumor (GH(3)) cells. The exposure to SSM or SesA depressed the transient and late components of I(Na) with different potencies. The IC(50) value of SSM needed to lessen the peak or sustained I(Na) was calculated to be 7.2 or 0.6 μM, while that of SesA was 9.8 or 2.5 μM, respectively. The dissociation constant of SSM-perturbed inhibition on I(Na), based on the first-order reaction scheme, was measured to be 0.93 μM, a value very similar to the IC(50) for its depressant action on sustained I(Na). The addition of SSM was also effective at suppressing the amplitude of resurgent I(Na). The addition of SSM could concentration-dependently inhibit the I(K(M)) amplitude with an IC(50) value of 4.8 μM. SSM at a concentration of 30 μM could suppress the amplitude of I(K(erg)), while at 10 μM, it mildly decreased the I(K(DR)) amplitude. However, the addition of neither SSM (10 μM) nor SesA (10 μM) altered the amplitude or kinetics of I(h) in response to long-lasting hyperpolarization. Additionally, in this study, a modified Markovian model designed for SCN8A-encoded (or Na(V)1.6) channels was implemented to evaluate the plausible modifications of SSM on the gating kinetics of Na(V) channels. The model demonstrated herein was well suited to predict that the SSM-mediated decrease in peak I(Na), followed by increased current inactivation, which could largely account for its favorable decrease in the probability of the open-blocked over open state of Na(V) channels. Collectively, our study provides evidence that highlights the notion that SSM or SesA could block multiple ion currents, such as I(Na) and I(K(M)), and suggests that these actions are potentially important and may participate in the functional activities of various electrically excitable cells in vivo.","Ping-Chung Kuo, Zi-Han Kao, Shih-Wei Lee & Sheng-Nan Wu.

modeldb-260730,"Low frequency firing is modeled by Type 1 neurons with a SNIC, but, because of the vertical slope of the square-root-like f–I curve, low f only occurs over a narrow range of I. When an adaptive current is added, however, the f–I curve is linearized, and low f occurs robustly over a large I range. Ermentrout (Neural Comput. 10(7):1721-1729, 1998) showed that this feature of adaptation paradoxically arises from the SNIC that is responsible for the vertical slope. We show, using a simplified Hindmarsh–Rose neuron with negative feedback acting directly on the adaptation current, that whereas a SNIC contributes to linearization, in practice linearization over a large interval may require strong adaptation strength. We also find that a type 2 neuron with threshold generated by a Hopf bifurcation can also show linearization if adaptation strength is strong. Thus, a SNIC is not necessary. More fundamental than a SNIC is stretching the steep region near threshold, which stems from sufficiently strong adaptation, though a SNIC contributes if present. In a more realistic conductance-based model, Morris–Lecar, with negative feedback acting on the adaptation conductance, an additional assumption that the driving force of the adaptation current is independent of I is needed. If this holds, strong adaptive conductance is both necessary and sufficient for linearization of f–I curves of type 2 f–I curves.","Arthur S. Sherman & Joon Ha.

Modeling revealed two potential mechanisms for the drop in accumbal dopamine efflux evoked by the selective α7 partial agonist TC-7020. TC-7020 could desensitize α7 NNRs located predominantly on dopamine neurons or glutamatergic afferents to them or, alternatively, activate α7 NNRs located on the glutamatergic afferents to GABAergic interneurons in the ventral tegmental area. Only the model based on desensitization, however, was able to explain the neutralizing effect of coapplied PNU-120596, a positive allosteric modulator.

modeldb-148637,"Suppression of excessively synchronous beta-band oscillatory activity in the brain is believed to suppress hypokinetic motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Recently, a lot of interest has been devoted to desynchronizing delayed feedback deep brain stimulation (DBS). This type of synchrony control was shown to destabilize the synchronized state in networks of simple model oscillators as well as in networks of coupled model neurons. However, the dynamics of the neural activity in Parkinson’s disease exhibits complex intermittent synchronous patterns, far from the idealized synchronous dynamics used to study the delayed feedback stimulation. This study explores the action of delayed feedback stimulation on partially synchronized oscillatory dynamics, similar to what one observes experimentally in parkinsonian patients. We employ a computational model of the basal ganglia networks which reproduces experimentally observed fine temporal structure of the synchronous dynamics. When the parameters of our model are such that the synchrony is unphysiologically strong, the feedback exerts a desynchronizing action. However, when the network is tuned to reproduce the highly variable temporal patterns observed experimentally, the same kind of delayed feedback may actually increase the synchrony. As network parameters are changed from the range which produces complete synchrony to those favoring less synchronous dynamics, desynchronizing delayed feedback may gradually turn into synchronizing stimulation. This suggests that delayed feedback DBS in Parkinson’s disease may boost rather than suppress synchronization and is unlikely to be clinically successful. The study also indicates that delayed feedback stimulation may not necessarily exhibit a desynchronization effect when acting on a physiologically realistic partially synchronous dynamics, and provides an example of how to estimate the stimulation effect.","Andrey Dovzhenok, Choongseok Park, Robert M.

modeldb-229640,"How sensory information influences the dynamics of rhythm generation varies across systems, and general principles for understanding this aspect of motor control are lacking. Determining the origin of respiratory rhythm generation is challenging because the mechanisms in a central circuit considered in isolation may be different from those in the intact organism. We analyze a closed-loop respiratory control model incorporating a central pattern generator (CPG), the Butera-Rinzel-Smith (BRS) model, together with lung mechanics, oxygen handling, and chemosensory components. We show that 1) embedding the BRS model neuron in a control loop creates a bistable system; 2) although closed-loop and open-loop (isolated) CPG systems both support eupnea-like bursting activity, they do so via distinct mechanisms; 3) chemosensory feedback in the closed loop improves robustness to variable metabolic demand; 4) the BRS model conductances provide an autoresuscitation mechanism for recovery from transient interruption of chemosensory feedback; and 5) the in vitro brain stem CPG slice responds to hypoxia with transient bursting that is qualitatively similar to in silico autoresuscitation. Bistability of bursting and tonic spiking in the closed-loop system corresponds to coexistence of eupnea-like breathing, with normal minute ventilation and blood oxygen level and a tachypnea-like state, with pathologically reduced minute ventilation and critically low blood oxygen. Disruption of the normal breathing rhythm, through either imposition of hypoxia or interruption of chemosensory feedback, can push the system from the eupneic state into the tachypneic state. We use geometric singular perturbation theory to analyze the system dynamics at the boundary separating eupnea-like and tachypnea-like outcomes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A common challenge facing rhythmic biological processes is the adaptive regulation of central pattern generator (CPG) activity in response to sensory feedback. We apply dynamical systems tools to understand several properties of a closed-loop respiratory control model, including the coexistence of normal and pathological breathing, robustness to changes in metabolic demand, spontaneous autoresuscitation in response to hypoxia, and the distinct mechanisms that underlie rhythmogenesis in the intact control circuit vs. the isolated, open-loop CPG.","Casey O.

Ca2i-oscillations-in-sympathetic-neurons--an-experimental-test-of-a-theoretical-model,"[Ca2+]i oscillations have been described in a variety of cells. This study focuses on caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Previous work has shown that these oscillations require Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive store. The aim of the study was to understand the mechanism responsible for the oscillations. As a starting point, [Ca2+]i relaxations were examined after membrane depolarization and exposure to caffeine. For both stimuli, post-stimulus relaxations could be described by the sum of two decaying exponential functions, consistent with a one-pool system in which Ca2+ transport between compartments is regulated by linear Ca2+ pumps and leaks. After modifying the store to include a [Ca2+]i-sensitive leak, the model also exhibits oscillations such as those observed experimentally. The model was tested by comparing measured and predicted net Ca2+ fluxes during the oscillatory cycle. Three independent fluxes were measured, describing the rates of 1) Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, 2) Ca2+ release by the internal store, and 3) Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane and uptake by the internal store. Starting with estimates of the model parameters deduced from post-stimulus relaxations and the rapid upstroke, a set of parameter values was found that provides a good description of [Ca2+]i throughout the oscillatory cycle. With the same parameter values, there was also good agreement between the measured and simulated net fluxes. Thus, a one-pool model with a single [Ca2+]i-sensitive Ca2+ permeability is adequate to account for many of the quantitative properties of steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Inactivation of the intracellular Ca2+ permeability, cooperative nonlinear Ca2+ uptake and extrusion mechanisms, and functional links between plasma membrane Ca2+ transport and the internal store are not required.","D.D.

The paper explores the activation of liver glycogen phosphorylase by calcium oscillations through a theoretical study. The researchers propose a mathematical model that considers the effects of various factors such as enzyme activation, calcium-ion binding to the enzyme, and phosphorylase kinase on the activation process. The authors conclude that the activation of liver glycogen phosphorylase requires a constant elevated level of calcium concentration and a minimum threshold of calcium concentration, which is necessary to overcome the enzyme's inhibitory effect. The theoretical model developed may be useful in understanding the regulation of metabolism and in developing therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.","DAVID GALL, ERIKA BAUS & GENEVIÈVE DUPONT.

The paper presents a mathematical model of T cell development and regulation, focusing on the balance between self-tolerance and autoimmunity. The model includes regulatory T cells (Tregs), which can suppress the activation of self-reactive effector T cells (Teffs), and investigates how this regulatory mechanism affects the development of autoimmune diseases. The authors use the model to explore how various factors, such as the strength of Treg suppression and the presence of antigen-presenting cells, influence the balance between self-tolerance and autoimmunity. They also examine the impact of different types of Treg populations and the effects of changes in the level of antigen exposure. Overall, the paper provides insights into the complex dynamics of T cell regulation and highlights the importance of Tregs in maintaining immune balance.","H. K. Alexander & L. M. Wahl.

An-integrated-model-of-eicosanoid-metabolism-and-signaling-based-on-lipidomics-flux-analysis,"There is increasing evidence for a major and critical involvement of lipids in signal transduction and cellular trafficking, and this has motivated large-scale studies on lipid pathways. The Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy consortium is actively investigating lipid metabolism in mammalian cells and has made available time-course data on various lipids in response to treatment with KDO(2)-lipid A (a lipopolysaccharide analog) of macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. The lipids known as eicosanoids play an important role in inflammation. We have reconstructed an integrated network of eicosanoid metabolism and signaling based on the KEGG pathway database and the literature and have developed a kinetic model. A matrix-based approach was used to estimate the rate constants from experimental data and these were further refined using generalized constrained nonlinear optimization. The resulting model fits the experimental data well for all species, and simulated enzyme activities were similar to their literature values. The quantitative model for eicosanoid metabolism that we have developed can be used to design experimental studies utilizing genetic and pharmacological perturbations to probe fluxes in lipid pathways.","Shakti Gupta, Mano Ram Maurya, Daren L.

An-updated-computational-model-of-rabbit-sinoatrial-action-potential-to-investigate-the-mechanisms-of-heart-rate-modulation-,"The cellular basis of cardiac pacemaking is still debated. Reliable computational models of the sinoatrial node (SAN) action potential (AP) may help gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Recently, novel models incorporating detailed Ca(2+)-handling dynamics have been proposed, but they fail to reproduce a number of experimental data, and more specifically effects of ‘funny’ (I(f)) current modifications. We therefore developed a SAN AP model, based on available experimental data, in an attempt to reproduce physiological and pharmacological heart rate modulation. Cell compartmentalization and intracellular Ca(2+)-handling mechanisms were formulated as in the Maltsev–Lakatta model, focusing on Ca(2+)-cycling processes. Membrane current equations were revised on the basis of published experimental data. Modifications of the formulation of currents/pumps/exchangers to simulate I(f) blockers, autonomic modulators and Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms (ivabradine, caesium, acetylcholine, isoprenaline, BAPTA) were derived from experimental data. The model generates AP waveforms typical of rabbit SAN cells, whose parameters fall within the experimental ranges: 352 ms cycle length, 80 mV AP amplitude, −58 mV maximum diastolic potential (MDP), 108 ms APD(50), and 7.1 V s(−1) maximum upstroke velocity. Rate modulation by I(f)-blocking drugs agrees with experimental findings: 20% and 22% caesium-induced (5 mm) and ivabradine-induced (3 μm) rate reductions, respectively, due to changes in diastolic depolarization (DD) slope, with no changes in either MDP or take-off potential (TOP). The model consistently reproduces the effects of autonomic modulation: 20% rate decrease with 10 nm acetylcholine and 28% increase with 1 μm isoprenaline, again entirely due to increase in the DD slope, with no changes in either MDP or TOP. Model testing of BAPTA effects showed slowing of rate, −26%, without cessation of beating. Our up-to-date model describes satisfactorily experimental data concerning autonomic stimulation, funny-channel blockade and inhibition of the Ca(2+)-related system by BAPTA, making it a useful tool for further investigation. Simulation results suggest that a detailed description of the intracellular Ca(2+) fluxes is fully compatible with the observation that I(f) is a major component of pacemaking and rate modulation.","Stefano Severi, Matteo Fantini, Lara A.

We show that neither very fast nor very slow conduction is safe, and there exists an optimal velocity that provides the maximum safety factor for conduction through the junction. The resultant conduction time delay across the PVJ is a natural consequence of the electrophysiological and morphological differences between the Purkinje fiber and ventricular tissue. The delay allows the PVJ to accumulate and pass sufficient charge to excite the adjacent ventricular tissue, but is not long enough for the source-to-load mismatch at the junction to be enhanced over time.

Aslanidi-Boyett-Dobrzynski-Li-Zhang-2009,"Experimental evidence suggests that regional differences in action potential (AP) morphology can provide a substrate for initiation and maintenance of reentrant arrhythmias in the right atrium (RA), but the relationships between the complex electrophysiological and anatomical organization of the RA and the genesis of reentry are unclear. In this study, a biophysically detailed three-dimensional computer model of the right atrial tissue was constructed to study the role of tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy in arrhythmogenesis. The model of Lindblad et al. for a rabbit atrial cell was modified to incorporate experimental data on regional differences in several ionic currents (primarily, I(Na), I(CaL), I(K1), I(to), and I(sus)) between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscle cells. The modified model was validated by its ability to reproduce the AP properties measured experimentally. The anatomical model of the rabbit RA (including tissue geometry and fiber orientation) was based on a recent histological reconstruction. Simulations with the resultant electrophysiologically and anatomically detailed three-dimensional model show that complex organization of the RA tissue causes breakdown of regular AP conduction patterns at high pacing rates (>11.75 Hz): as the AP in the crista terminalis cells is longer, and electrotonic coupling transverse to fibers of the crista terminalis is weak, high-frequency pacing at the border between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles results in a unidirectional conduction block toward the crista terminalis and generation of reentry. Contributions of the tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy to reentry initiation mechanisms are quantified by measuring action potential duration (APD) gradients at the border between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscles: the APD gradients are high in areas where both heterogeneity and anisotropy are high, such that intrinsic APD differences are not diminished by electrotonic interactions.

Bagci-Vodovotz-Billiar-Ermentrout-Bahar-2006,"We propose a mathematical model for mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, in which kinetic cooperativity in formation of the apoptosome is a key element ensuring bistability. We examine the role of Bax and Bcl-2 synthesis and degradation rates, as well as the number of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs), on the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Our analysis suggests that cooperative apoptosome formation is a mechanism for inducing bistability, much more robust than that induced by other mechanisms, such as inhibition of caspase-3 by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). Simulations predict a pathological state in which cells will exhibit a monostable cell survival if Bax degradation rate is above a threshold value, or if Bax expression rate is below a threshold value. Otherwise, cell death or survival occur depending on initial caspase-3 levels. We show that high expression rates of Bcl-2 can counteract the effects of Bax. Our simulations also demonstrate a monostable (pathological) apoptotic response if the number of MPTPs exceeds a threshold value. This study supports our contention, based on mathematical modeling, that cooperativity in apoptosome formation is critically important for determining the healthy responses to apoptotic stimuli, and helps define the roles of Bax, Bcl-2, and MPTP vis-à-vis apoptosome formation.","E.Z.

Barberis-Klipp-Vanoni-Alberghina-2007,"The eukaryotic cell cycle is the repeated sequence of events that enable the division of a cell into two daughter cells. It is divided into four phases: G(1), S, G(2), and M. Passage through the cell cycle is strictly regulated by a molecular interaction network, which involves the periodic synthesis and destruction of cyclins that bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases that are present in nonlimiting amounts. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors contribute to cell cycle control. Budding yeast is an established model organism for cell cycle studies, and several mathematical models have been proposed for its cell cycle. An area of major relevance in cell cycle control is the G(1) to S transition. In any given growth condition, it is characterized by the requirement of a specific, critical cell size, P(S), to enter S phase. The molecular basis of this control is still under discussion. The authors report a mathematical model of the G(1) to S network that newly takes into account nucleo/cytoplasmic localization, the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase Sic1 in facilitating nuclear import of its cognate Cdk1-Clb5, Whi5 control, and carbon source regulation of Sic1 and Sic1-containing complexes. The model was implemented by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the temporal change of the concentration of the involved proteins and protein complexes. The model was tested by simulation in several genetic and nutritional setups and was found to be neatly consistent with experimental data. To estimate P(S), the authors developed a hybrid model including a probabilistic component for firing of DNA replication origins. Sensitivity analysis of P(S) provides a novel relevant conclusion: P(S) is an emergent property of the G(1) to S network that strongly depends on growth rate.","Matteo Barberis, Edda Klipp, Marco Vanoni & Lilia Alberghina.

A distinctive feature of the model is the inclusion of a binding reaction between fluo-3 and myoplasmic proteins, a process that strongly affects fluo-3′s Ca(2+)-reaction kinetics, its apparent diffusion constant, and hence the morphology of sparks. ΔF/F (the change in fluo-3′s fluorescence divided by its resting fluorescence) was estimated from the calculated changes in fluo-3 convolved with the microscope point-spread function. To facilitate comparisons with measured sparks, noise and other sources of variability were included in a random repetitive fashion to generate a large number of simulated sparks that could be analyzed in the same way as the measured sparks. In the initial simulations, the binding of Ca(2+) to the two regulatory sites on troponin was assumed to follow identical and independent binding reactions. These simulations failed to accurately predict the falling phase of the measured sparks. A second set of simulations, which incorporated the idea of positive cooperativity in the binding of Ca(2+) to troponin, produced reasonable agreement with the measurements. Under the assumption that the single channel Ca(2+) current of a ryanodine receptor (RYR) is 0.5–2 pA, the results suggest that 1–5 active RYRs generate an average Ca(2+) spark in a frog intact muscle fiber.","S.M.

Beard-2005,"A computational model for the mitochondrial respiratory chain that appropriately balances mass, charge, and free energy transduction is introduced and analyzed based on a previously published set of data measured on isolated cardiac mitochondria. The basic components included in the model are the reactions at complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport system, ATP synthesis at F(1)F(0) ATPase, substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate–hydrogen co-transporter, and cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the K(+)/H(+) antiporter and passive H(+) and K(+) permeation. Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.","Daniel A Beard.

The author first presents a detailed mathematical model of gas exchange, which includes complex mechanisms such as diffusion and perfusion. Then, the author shows how this model can be simplified into more manageable forms by making various assumptions and approximations. Two simplified models are presented and analyzed in detail. The first one describes the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between alveolar air and blood in the lung, while the second one focuses on the dynamics of oxygen uptake within the tissue.

Bertram-Previte-Sherman-Kinard-Satin-2000,"Pancreatic beta-cells exhibit bursting oscillations with a wide range of periods. Whereas periods in isolated cells are generally either a few seconds or a few minutes, in intact islets of Langerhans they are intermediate (10-60 s). We develop a mathematical model for beta-cell electrical activity capable of generating this wide range of bursting oscillations. Unlike previous models, bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically medium.","Richard Bertram, Joseph Previte, Arthur Sherman, Tracie A.

Bornheimer-Maurya-Farquhar-Subramaniam-2004,"Heterotrimeric G protein signaling is regulated by signaling modules composed of heterotrimeric G proteins, active G protein-coupled receptors (Rs), which activate G proteins, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which deactivate G proteins. We term these modules GTPase-cycle modules. The local concentrations of these proteins are spatially regulated between plasma membrane microdomains and between the plasma membrane and cytosol, but no data or models are available that quantitatively explain the effect of such regulation on signaling. We present a computational model of the GTPase-cycle module that predicts that the interplay of local G protein, R, and GAP concentrations gives rise to 16 distinct signaling regimes and numerous intermediate signaling phenomena. The regimes suggest alternative modes of the GTPase-cycle module that occur based on defined local concentrations of the component proteins. In one mode, signaling occurs while G protein and receptor are unclustered and GAP eliminates signaling; in another, G protein and receptor are clustered and GAP can rapidly modulate signaling but does not eliminate it. Experimental data from multiple GTPase-cycle modules is interpreted in light of these predictions. The latter mode explains previously paradoxical data in which GAP does not alter maximal current amplitude of G protein-activated ion channels, but hastens signaling. The predictions indicate how variations in local concentrations of the component proteins create GTPase-cycle modules with distinctive phenotypes. They provide a quantitative framework for investigating how regulation of local concentrations of components of the GTPase-cycle module affects signaling.","Scott J. Bornheimer, Mano R.

During these mitotic cycles, there are barely detectable oscillations in the total level of B-type cyclins. In this paper, we propose a dynamical model for the molecular events underlying these early nuclear division cycles in Drosophila. The model distinguishes nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the embryo and permits exploration of a variety of rules for protein transport between the compartments. Numerical simulations reproduce the main features of wild-type mitotic cycles: patterns of protein accumulation and degradation, lengthening of later cycles, and arrest in interphase 14. The model is consistent with mutations that introduce subtle changes in the number of mitotic cycles before interphase arrest. Bifurcation analysis of the differential equations reveals the dependence of mitotic oscillations on cycle number, and how this dependence is altered by mutations.

In addition, the model allows one to frame and critique hypotheses about how the division cycle is regulated in wild-type and mutant cells, to predict the phenotypes of new mutant combinations, and to estimate the effective values of biochemical rate constants that are difficult to measure directly in vivo.","Katherine C.

Chen-Csikasz-Nagy-Gyorffy-Val-Novak-Tyson-2000,"The molecular machinery of cell cycle control is known in more detail for budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, than for any other eukaryotic organism. In recent years, many elegant experiments on budding yeast have dissected the roles of cyclin molecules (Cln1–3 and Clb1–6) in coordinating the events of DNA synthesis, bud emergence, spindle formation, nuclear division, and cell separation. These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation. Using standard techniques of biochemical kinetics, we convert the mechanism into a set of differential equations, which describe the time courses of three major classes of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Model in hand, we examine the molecular events controlling “Start” (the commitment step to a new round of chromosome replication, bud formation, and mitosis) and “Finish” (the transition from metaphase to anaphase, when sister chromatids are pulled apart and the bud separates from the mother cell) in wild-type cells and 50 mutants. The model accounts for many details of the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of cell cycle control in budding yeast.","Katherine C.

Central to the checkpoint mechanism is Swe1 kinase: normally inactive, its activation halts cell cycle progression in G2. We propose a molecular network for Swe1 control, based on published observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity.

The paper explores the cellular consequences of mutations in HERG, a gene that encodes for a cardiac potassium channel that plays a crucial role in regulating heart rhythm. Mutations in HERG have been linked to a condition called long QT syndrome, which can lead to sudden cardiac death.

It also highlights the importance of understanding the molecular and cellular changes associated with HERG mutations in order to develop effective treatments for patients with long QT syndrome.","Clancy CE & Rudy Y.

Clancy-Rudy-2002,"BACKGROUND: Complex physiological interactions determine the functional consequences of gene abnormalities and make mechanistic interpretation of phenotypes extremely difficult. A recent example is a single mutation in the C terminus of the cardiac Na(+) channel, 1795insD. The mutation causes two distinct clinical syndromes, long QT (LQT) and Brugada, leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate. We develop Markov models of the wild-type and 1795insD cardiac Na(+) channels. By incorporating the models into a virtual transgenic cell, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1795insD differentially disrupts cellular electrical behavior in epicardial and midmyocardial cell types. We provide a cellular mechanistic basis for the ECG abnormalities observed in patients carrying the 1795insD gene mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation can cause both LQT and Brugada syndromes through interaction with the heterogeneous myocardium in a rate-dependent manner. The results highlight the complexity and multiplicity of genotype-phenotype relationships, and the usefulness of computational approaches in establishing a mechanistic link between genetic defects and functional abnormalities.","Colleen E.

Cortassa-Aon-Marban-Winslow-ORourke-2003,"We present an integrated thermokinetic model describing control of cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics. The model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling. The kinetic component of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH(2), which in turn are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force (Δμ(H)), driving the F(1)F(0)-ATPase. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+), determined by Ca(2+) uniporter and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger activities, regulates activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The model is described by twelve ordinary differential equations for the time rate of change of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)), and matrix concentrations of Ca(2+), NADH, ADP, and TCA cycle intermediates. The model is used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange, and Ca(2+). The model is able to reproduce, qualitatively and semiquantitatively, experimental data concerning mitochondrial bioenergetics, Ca(2+) dynamics, and respiratory control. Significant increases in oxygen consumption (V(O(2))), proton efflux, NADH, and ATP synthesis, in response to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), are obtained when the Ca(2+)-sensitive dehydrogenases are the main rate-controlling steps of respiratory flux. These responses diminished when control is shifted downstream (e.g., the respiratory chain or adenine nucleotide translocator). The time-dependent behavior of the model, under conditions simulating an increase in workload, closely reproduces experimentally observed mitochondrial NADH dynamics in heart trabeculae subjected to changes in pacing frequency. The steady-state and time-dependent behavior of the model support the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.","Sonia Cortassa, Miguel A.

Cronwright-Rohwer-Prior-2002,"Glycerol, a major by-product of ethanol fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is of significant importance to the wine, beer, and ethanol production industries. To gain a clearer understanding of and to quantify the extent to which parameters of the pathway affect glycerol flux in S. cerevisiae, a kinetic model of the glycerol synthesis pathway has been constructed. Kinetic parameters were collected from published values. Maximal enzyme activities and intracellular effector concentrations were determined experimentally. The model was validated by comparing experimental results on the rate of glycerol production to the rate calculated by the model. Values calculated by the model agreed well with those measured in independent experiments. The model also mimics the changes in the rate of glycerol synthesis at different phases of growth. Metabolic control analysis values calculated by the model indicate that the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction has a flux control coefficient (Cv1J) of approximately 0.85 and exercises the majority of the control of flux through the pathway. Response coefficients of parameter metabolites indicate that flux through the pathway is most responsive to dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration (RDHAPJ = 0.48 to 0.69), followed by ATP concentration (RATPJ = −0.21 to −0.50). Interestingly, the pathway responds weakly to NADH concentration (RNADHJ = 0.03 to 0.08). The model indicates that the best strategy to increase flux through the pathway is not to increase enzyme activity, substrate concentration, or coenzyme concentration alone but to increase all of these parameters in conjunction with each other.","Garth R.

The idiosyncrasies of cell cycle regulation in particular organisms can be attributed, we claim, to specific settings of rate constants in the dynamic network of chemical reactions. The values of these rate constants are determined ultimately by the genetic makeup of an organism. To support these claims, we convert the reaction mechanism into a set of governing kinetic equations and provide parameter values (specific to budding yeast, fission yeast, frog eggs, and mammalian cells) that account for many curious features of cell cycle regulation in these organisms. Using one-parameter bifurcation diagrams, we show how overall cell growth drives progression through the cell cycle, how cell-size homeostasis can be achieved by two different strategies, and how mutations remodel bifurcation diagrams and create unusual cell-division phenotypes. The relation between gene dosage and phenotype can be summarized compactly in two-parameter bifurcation diagrams. Our approach provides a theoretical framework in which to understand both the universality and particularity of cell cycle regulation, and to construct, in modular fashion, increasingly complex models of the networks controlling cell growth and division.","Attila Csikász-Nagy, Dorjsuren Battogtokh, Katherine C.

Decker-Heijman-Silva-Hund-Rudy-2009,"Computational models of cardiac myocytes are important tools for understanding ionic mechanisms of arrhythmia. This work presents a new model of the canine epicardial myocyte that reproduces a wide range of experimentally observed rate-dependent behaviors in cardiac cell and tissue, including action potential (AP) duration (APD) adaptation, restitution, and accommodation. Model behavior depends on updated formulations for the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (I(to1)), the slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)), the L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)), and the Na(+)-K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) fit to data from canine ventricular myocytes. We found that I(to1) plays a limited role in potentiating peak I(Ca,L) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release for propagated APs but modulates the time course of APD restitution. I(Ks) plays an important role in APD shortening at short diastolic intervals, despite a limited role in AP repolarization at longer cycle lengths. In addition, we found that I(Ca,L) plays a critical role in APD accommodation and rate dependence of APD restitution. Ca(2+) entry via I(Ca,L) at fast rate drives increased Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger Ca(2+) extrusion and Na(+) entry, which in turn increases Na(+) extrusion via outward I(NaK). APD accommodation results from this increased outward I(NaK). Our simulation results provide valuable insight into the mechanistic basis of rate-dependent phenomena important for determining the heart's response to rapid and irregular pacing rates (e.g., arrhythmia). Accurate simulation of rate-dependent phenomena and increased understanding of their mechanistic basis will lead to more realistic multicellular simulations of arrhythmia and identification of molecular therapeutic targets.","Keith F.

Egli-Bertram-Sellix-Freeman-2004,"Prolactin (PRL) is secreted from lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland of rats in a unique pattern in response to uterine cervical stimulation (CS) during mating. Surges of PRL secretion occur in response to relief from hypothalamic dopaminergic (DA) inhibition and stimulation by hypothalamic releasing neurohormones. In this study we characterize the role of oxytocin (OT) in this system and the involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in controlling OT and PRL secretion of CS rats. The effect of OT on PRL secretion was demonstrated in cultured lactotrophs showing simultaneous enhanced secretion rate and increased intracellular Ca(2+). Neurosecretory OT cells of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus which express VIP receptors were identified by using immunocytochemical techniques in combination with the retrogradely transported neuronal tracer Fluoro-Gold (i.v. injected). OT measurements of serial blood samples obtained from ovariectomized (OVX) CS rats displayed a prominent secretory peak at the time of the afternoon PRL peak. The injection of VIP antisense oligonucleotides into the SCN abolished the afternoon increase of OT and PRL in CS-OVX animals. These findings suggest that there is an involvement of VIP from the SCN contributing in the regulation of OT and PRL secretion in CS rats. We propose that in CS rats the regulatory mechanism(s) for PRL secretion comprise coordinated action of neuroendocrine DA and OT cells, both governed by the daily rhythm of VIPergic output from the SCN. This hypothesis is illustrated with a mathematical model.","Marcel Egli, Richard Bertram, Michael T. Sellix & Marc E. Freeman.

Eskandari-Wright-Loo-,"This study investigates the reverse mode of the Na(+)/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1). In giant excised inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1, application of α-methyl-d-glucopyranoside (αMDG) to the cytoplasmic solution induced an outward current from cytosolic to external membrane surface. The outward current was Na(+) - and sugar-dependent, and was blocked by phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of SGLT1. The current-voltage relationship saturated at positive membrane voltages (30–50 mV), and approached zero at − 150 mV. The half-maximal concentration for αMDG-evoked outward current ([Formula: see text]) was 35 mM (at 0 mV). In comparison, [Formula: see text] for forward sugar transport was 0.15 mM (at 0 mV). [Formula: see text] was similar for forward and reverse transport (≈35 mM at 0 mV). Specificity of SGLT1 for reverse transport was: αMDG (1.0) > d-galactose (0.84) > 3-O-methyl-glucose (0.55) > d-glucose (0.38), whereas for forward transport, specificity was: αMDG ≈ d-glucose ≈ d-galactose > 3-O-methyl-glucose. Thus there is an asymmetry in sugar kinetics and specificity between forward and reverse modes. Computer simulations showed that a 6-state kinetic model for SGLT1 can account for Na(+)/sugar cotransport and its voltage dependence in both the forward and reverse modes at saturating sodium concentrations. Our data indicate that under physiological conditions, the transporter is poised to accumulate sugar efficiently in the enterocyte.","S. Eskandari, E.M. Wright & D.D.F. Loo.

Faber-Rudy-2000,"Sodium overload of cardiac cells can accompany various pathologies and induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias. We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L)) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD shortening is negligible. By slowing AP depolarization (hence velocity) and shortening APD, Na(+)-overload acts to enhance inducibility of reentrant arrhythmias. Shortened APD with elevated [Ca(2+)](i) (secondary to Na(+)-overload) also predisposes the myocardium to arrhythmogenic delayed afterdepolarizations.","Gregory M. Faber & Yoram Rudy.

A model of this process was built using the ""virtual cell,"" a general computational system for integrating experimental image, biochemical, and electrophysiological data. The model geometry was based on a cell for which the calcium wave had been experimentally recorded. The distributions of the relevant cellular components [InsP(3) receptor (InsP(3)R)], sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps, bradykinin receptors, and ER] were based on 3D confocal immunofluorescence images. Wherever possible, known biochemical and electrophysiological data were used to constrain the model. The simulation closely matched the spatial and temporal characteristics of the experimental calcium wave. Predictions on different patterns of calcium signals after InsP(3) uncaging or for different cell geometries were confirmed experimentally, thus helping to validate the model. Models in which the spatial distributions of key components are altered suggest that initiation of the wave in the center of the neurite derives from an interplay of soma-biased ER distribution and InsP(3) generation biased toward the neurite. Simulations demonstrate that mobile buffers (like the indicator fura-2) significantly delay initiation and lower the amplitude of the wave. Analysis of the role played by calcium diffusion indicated that the speed of the wave is only slightly dependent on the ability of calcium to diffuse to and activate neighboring InsP(3) receptor sites.","Charles C.

The fraction of time spent in the active phase over a period is called the plateau fraction and is correlated with the rate of insulin release. However, the mechanisms that regulate the plateau fraction remain unclear. In this paper we investigate the possible role of the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchange of the beta-cell in controlling the plateau fraction. We have extended different single-cell models to incorporate this Ca2+-activated electrogenic Ca2+ transporter. We find that the Na+/Ca2+ exchange can provide a physiological mechanism to increase the plateau fraction as the glucose concentration is raised. In addition, we show theoretically that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is a key regulator of the cytoplasmic calcium concentration in clusters of heterogeneous cells with gap-junctional electrical coupling.","David Gall & Isabella Susa.

They also found that PKA activity is necessary for Msn2 to enter the nucleus, and that PKA activity oscillates with the same period as Msn2 localization.

Gerard-Goldbeter-2010,"We propose an integrated computational model for the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that controls the dynamics of the mammalian cell cycle. The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by reversible phosphorylation, Cdk inhibitors, and protein synthesis or degradation. Growth factors (GFs) trigger the transition from a quiescent, stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. These oscillations correspond to the repetitive, transient activation of cyclin D/Cdk4–6 in G(1), cyclin E/Cdk2 at the G(1)/S transition, cyclin A/Cdk2 in S and at the S/G(2) transition, and cyclin B/Cdk1 at the G(2)/M transition. The model accounts for the following major properties of the mammalian cell cycle: (i) repetitive cell cycling in the presence of suprathreshold amounts of GF; (ii) control of cell-cycle progression by the balance between antagonistic effects of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the transcription factor E2F; and (iii) existence of a restriction point in G(1), beyond which completion of the cell cycle becomes independent of GF. The model also accounts for endoreplication. Incorporating the DNA replication checkpoint mediated by kinases ATR and Chk1 slows down the dynamics of the cell cycle without altering its oscillatory nature and leads to better separation of the S and M phases. The model for the mammalian cell cycle shows how the regulatory structure of the Cdk network results in its temporal self-organization, leading to the repetitive, sequential activation of the four Cdk modules that brings about the orderly progression along cell-cycle phases.","Claude Gérard & Albert Goldbeter.

Our aims were to: 1) simulate basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; 2) use realistic repolarizing K current densities; 3) reach steady-state. The model relies on the framework of the rabbit myocyte model previously developed by our group, with subsarcolemmal and junctional compartments where ion channels sense higher [Ca] vs. bulk cytosol. Ion channels and transporters have been modeled on the basis of the most recent experimental data from human ventricular myocytes. Rapidly and slowly inactivating components of I(to) have been formulated to differentiate between endocardial and epicardial myocytes. Transmural gradients of Ca handling proteins and Na pump were also simulated. The model has been validated against a wide set of experimental data including action potential duration (APD) adaptation and restitution, frequency-dependent increase in Ca transient peak and [Na](i). Interestingly, Na accumulation at fast heart rate is a major determinant of APD shortening, via outward shifts in Na pump and Na-Ca exchange currents. We investigated the effects of blocking K currents on APD and repolarization reserve: I(Ks) block does not affect the former and slightly reduces the latter; I(K1) blockade modestly increases APD and more strongly reduces repolarization reserve; I(Kr) blockers significantly prolong APD, an effect exacerbated as pacing frequency is decreased, in good agreement with experimental results in human myocytes. We conclude that this model provides a useful framework to explore excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms and repolarization abnormalities at the single myocyte level.","Eleonora Grandi, Francesco S.

Gupta-Aslakson-Gurbaxani-Vernon-2007,"BACKGROUND: The body's primary stress management system is the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases. RESULTS: We developed a structured model of the HPA axis that includes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This model incorporates nonlinear kinetics of pituitary GR synthesis. The nonlinear effect arises from the fact that GR homodimerizes after cortisol activation and induces its own synthesis in the pituitary. This homodimerization makes possible two stable steady states (low and high) and one unstable state of cortisol production resulting in bistability of the HPA axis. In this model, low GR concentration represents the normal steady state, and high GR concentration represents a dysregulated steady state. A short stress in the normal steady state produces a small perturbation in the GR concentration that quickly returns to normal levels. Long, repeated stress produces persistent and high GR concentration that does not return to baseline forcing the HPA axis to an alternate steady state. One consequence of increased steady state GR is reduced steady state cortisol, which has been observed in some stress related disorders such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of pituitary GR expression resulted in a biologically plausible model of HPA axis bistability and hypocortisolism. High GR concentration enhanced cortisol negative feedback on the hypothalamus and forced the HPA axis into an alternative, low cortisol state. This model can be used to explore mechanisms underlying disorders of the HPA axis.","Shakti Gupta, Eric Aslakson, Brian M Gurbaxani & Suzanne D Vernon.

In the present study, we examined heregulin (HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259).

Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.","C Y Huang & J E Ferrell.

Hund-Rudy-2004,"BACKGROUND: Computational biology is a powerful tool for elucidating arrhythmogenic mechanisms at the cellular level, where complex interactions between ionic processes determine behavior. A novel theoretical model of the canine ventricular epicardial action potential and calcium cycling was developed and used to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) transient (CaT) and action potential duration (APD) rate dependence. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) regulatory pathway was integrated into the model, which included a novel Ca(2+)-release formulation, Ca(2+) subspace, dynamic chloride handling, and formulations for major ion currents based on canine ventricular data. Decreasing pacing cycle length from 8000 to 300 ms shortened APD primarily because of I(Ca(L)) reduction, with additional contributions from I(to1), I(NaK), and late I(Na). CaT amplitude increased as cycle length decreased from 8000 to 500 ms. This positive rate–dependent property depended on CaMKII activity. CONCLUSIONS: CaMKII is an important determinant of the rate dependence of CaT but not of APD, which depends on ion-channel kinetics. The model of CaMKII regulation may serve as a paradigm for modeling effects of other regulatory pathways on cell function.","Thomas J. Hund & Yoram Rudy.

Iancu-Jones-Harvey-2007,"Receptor-mediated changes in cAMP production play an essential role in sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation of the electrical, mechanical, and metabolic activity of cardiac myocytes. However, responses to receptor activation cannot be easily ascribed to a uniform increase or decrease in cAMP activity throughout the entire cell. In this study, we used a computational approach to test the hypothesis that in cardiac ventricular myocytes the effects of β(1)-adrenergic receptor (β(1)AR) and M(2) muscarinic receptor (M(2)R) activation involve compartmentation of cAMP. A model consisting of two submembrane (caveolar and extracaveolar) microdomains and one bulk cytosolic domain was created using published information on the location of β(1)ARs and M(2)Rs, as well as the location of stimulatory (G(s)) and inhibitory (G(i)) G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase isoforms inhibited (AC5/6) and stimulated (AC4/7) by G(i), and multiple phosphodiesterase isoforms (PDE2, PDE3, and PDE4). Results obtained with the model indicate that: 1), bulk basal cAMP can be high (∼1 μM) and only modestly stimulated by β(1)AR activation (∼2 μM), but caveolar cAMP varies in a range more appropriate for regulation of protein kinase A (∼100 nM to ∼2 μM); 2), M(2)R activation strongly reduces the β(1)AR-induced increases in caveolar cAMP, with less effect on bulk cAMP; and 3), during weak β(1)AR stimulation, M(2)R activation not only reduces caveolar cAMP, but also produces a rebound increase in caveolar cAMP following termination of M(2)R activity. We conclude that compartmentation of cAMP can provide a quantitative explanation for several aspects of cardiac signaling.","Radu V. Iancu, Stephen W. Jones & Robert D. Harvey.

Inada-Hancox-Zhang-Boyett-2009,"Mathematical models are a repository of knowledge as well as research and teaching tools. Although action potential models have been developed for most regions of the heart, there is no model for the atrioventricular node (AVN). We have developed action potential models for single atrio-nodal, nodal, and nodal-His cells. The models have the same action potential shapes and refractoriness as observed in experiments. Using these models, together with models for the sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrial muscle, we have developed a one-dimensional (1D) multicellular model including the SAN and AVN. The multicellular model has slow and fast pathways into the AVN and using it we have analyzed the rich behavior of the AVN. Under normal conditions, action potentials were initiated in the SAN center and then propagated through the atrium and AVN. The relationship between the AVN conduction time and the timing of a premature stimulus (conduction curve) is consistent with experimental data. After premature stimulation, atrioventricular nodal reentry could occur. After slow pathway ablation or block of the L-type Ca(2+) current, atrioventricular nodal reentry was abolished. During atrial fibrillation, the AVN limited the number of action potentials transmitted to the ventricle. In the absence of SAN pacemaking, the inferior nodal extension acted as the pacemaker. In conclusion, we have developed what we believe is the first detailed mathematical model of the AVN and it shows the typical physiological and pathophysiological characteristics of the tissue.

Iyer-Mazhari-Winslow-2004,"A computational model of the human left-ventricular epicardial myocyte is presented. Models of each of the major ionic currents present in these cells are formulated and validated using experimental data obtained from studies of recombinant human ion channels and/or whole-cell recording from single myocytes isolated from human left-ventricular subepicardium. Continuous-time Markov chain models for the gating of the fast Na(+) current, transient outward current, rapid component of the delayed rectifier current, and the L-type calcium current are modified to represent human data at physiological temperature. A new model for the gating of the slow component of the delayed rectifier current is formulated and validated against experimental data. Properties of calcium handling and exchanger currents are altered to appropriately represent the dynamics of intracellular ion concentrations. The model is able to both reproduce and predict a wide range of behaviors observed experimentally including action potential morphology, ionic currents, intracellular calcium transients, frequency dependence of action-potential duration, Ca(2+)-frequency relations, and extrasystolic restitution/post-extrasystolic potentiation. The model therefore serves as a useful tool for investigating mechanisms of arrhythmia and consequences of drug-channel interactions in the human left-ventricular myocyte.","Vivek Iyer, Reza Mazhari & Raimond L.

Jafri-Rice-Winslow-1998,"We construct a detailed mathematical model for Ca2+ regulation in the ventricular myocyte that includes novel descriptions of subcellular mechanisms based on recent experimental findings: 1) the Keizer-Levine model for the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which displays adaptation at elevated Ca2+; 2) a model for the L-type Ca2+ channel that inactivates by mode switching; and 3) a restricted subspace into which the RyRs and L-type Ca2+ channels empty and interact via Ca2+. We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+ handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR Ca2+ loading. This model, therefore, shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions of subcellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms.","M. Saleet Jafri, J. Jeremy Rice & Raimond L. Winslow.

Leloup-Goldbeter-2003,"We present a computational model for the mammalian circadian clock based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, Clock, and Rev-Erb α genes. In agreement with experimental observations, the model can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness, characterized by an antiphase relationship between Per/Cry/Rev-Erbα and Bmal1 mRNAs. Sustained oscillations correspond to the rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei. For other parameter values, damped oscillations can also be obtained in the model. These oscillations, which transform into sustained oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.","Jean-Christophe Leloup & Albert Goldbeter.

Livshitz-Rudy-2007,"Alternans of cardiac repolarization is associated with arrhythmias and sudden death. At the cellular level, alternans involves beat-to-beat oscillation of the action potential (AP) and possibly Ca(2+) transient (CaT). Because of experimental difficulty in independently controlling the Ca(2+) and electrical subsystems, mathematical modelling provides additional insights into mechanisms and causality. Pacing protocols were conducted in a canine ventricular myocyte model with the following results: 1. (I) CaT alternans results from refractoriness of the SR Ca(2+) release system; alternation of the L-type calcium current (I(Ca)(()(L)())) has a negligible effect; (II) CaT-AP coupling during late AP occurs through the sodium-calcium exchanger (I(NaCa)) and underlies APD alternans; (III) Increased Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity extends the range of CaT and APD alternans to slower frequencies and increases alternans magnitude; its decrease suppresses CaT and APD alternans, exerting an antiarrhythmic effect; (IV). Increase of the rapid delayed rectifier current (I(Kr)) also suppresses APD alternans, but without suppressing CaT alternans. Thus, CaMKII inhibition eliminates APD alternans by eliminating its cause (CaT alternans), while I(Kr) enhancement does so by weakening CaT-APD coupling. The simulations identify combined CaMKII inhibition and I(Kr) enhancement as a possible antiar-rhythmic intervention.","Leonid M. Livshitz & Yoram Rudy.

Incorporating a minimal seven-state Markovian model of I(Ca,L) that reproduced Ca- and voltage-dependent kinetics in combination with our previously published dynamic Ca(i) cycling model, the new model replicates experimentally observed action potential duration and Ca(i) transient alternans at rapid heart rates, and accurately reproduces experimental action potential duration restitution curves obtained by either dynamic or S1S2 pacing.","Aman Mahajan, Yohannes Shiferaw, Daisuke Sato, Ali Baher, Riccardo Olcese, Lai-Hua Xie, Ming-Jim Yang, Peng-Sheng Chen, Juan G.

Maltsev-Lakatta-2009,"Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases (Ca(2+) clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger current (I(NCX)). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited cardiac pacemaker cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca(2+) cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca(2+) releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-based Ca(2+) clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD I(NCX) over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e.g., L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and/or hyperpolarization-activated (“funny”) current (I(f)) conductances]. The system Ca(2+) clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca(2+) fluxes, which optimize cell Ca(2+) balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca(2+) release and late DD I(NCX) as SR Ca(2+) pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1.8–4.6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca(2+) clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca(2+) clock is disabled, the system parametric space for fail-safe SANC operation considerably shrinks: without rhythmic late DD I(NCX) ignition signals membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca(2+) clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function. A synergism of the coupled function of Ca(2+) and membrane clocks confers fail-safe SANC operation at greatly varying rates.","Victor A. Maltsev & Edward G. Lakatta.

Complementation between strains carrying different mutational defects in the sporulation control network may depend on the signaling state of the network components. We have previously suggested that time-resolved somatic complementation (TRSC) analysis with such mutants may be used to probe network architecture and dynamics. By computer simulation it is now shown how and under which conditions the regulatory hierarchy of genes can be determined experimentally. A kinetic model of the sporulation control network is developed, which is then used to demonstrate how the mechanisms of TRSC can be understood and simulated at the kinetic level. On the basis of theoretical considerations, experimental parameters that determine whether functional complementation of two mutations will occur are identified. It is also shown how gene dosage-effect relationships can be employed for network analysis. The theoretical framework provided may be used to systematically analyze network structure and dynamics through time-resolved somatic complementation studies. The conclusions drawn are of general relevance in that they do not depend on the validity of the model from which they were derived.","Wolfgang Marwan.

Coarse-grained biochemical models, called reduced-order models (ROMs), consisting of essential biochemical mechanisms are more useful for computational analysis and for studying important features of a biochemical network. The authors present a novel method to model-reduction by identifying potentially important parameters using multidimensional sensitivity analysis. A ROM is generated for the GTPase-cycle module of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, Gq, and regulator of G-protein signalling 4 (a GTPase-activating protein or GAP) starting from a detailed model of 48 reactions. The resulting ROM has only 17 reactions. The ROM suggested that complexes of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and GAP – which were proposed in the detailed model as a hypothesis – are required to fit the experimental data. Models previously published in the literature are also simulated and compared with the ROM. Through this comparison, a minimal ROM, that also requires complexes of GPCR and GAP, with just 15 parameters is generated.

Membrane action potentials and pace-maker activity were calculated and compared with time course of underlying changes in two functionally distinct outeard currents, iX1 and iK2. 3. The repolarization of the theoretical action potential is triggered by the onset of iX1, which becomes activated over the plateau range of potentials. iK2 also activates during the plateau but does not play a controlling role in the repolarization. Hwever, iK2 does govern the slow pace-maker depolarization through its subsequent deactivation at negative potentials. 4.

Michailova-McCulloch-2001,"We extended the model of the ventricular myocyte by Winslow et al. (Circ. Res 1999, 84:571-586) by incorporating equations for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) buffering and transport by ATP and ADP and equations for MgATP regulation of ion transporters (Na(+)-K(+) pump, sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) pumps). The results indicate that, under normal conditions, Ca(2+) binding by low-affinity ATP and diffusion of CaATP may affect the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The model also suggests that a fall in ATP/ADP ratio significantly reduces sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) content, increases diastolic Ca(2+), lowers systolic Ca(2+), increases Ca(2+) influx through L-type channels, and decreases the efficiency of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in extruding Ca(2+) during periodic voltage-clamp stimulation. The analysis suggests that the most important reason for these changes during metabolic inhibition is the down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase pump by reduced diastolic MgATP levels. High Ca(2+) concentrations developed near the membrane might have a greater influence on Mg(2+), ATP, and ADP concentrations than that of the lower Ca(2+) concentrations in the bulk myoplasm.

Mijailovich-Butler-Fredburg-2000,"We carried out a detailed mathematical analysis of the effects of length fluctuations on the dynamically evolving cross-bridge distributions, simulating those that occur in airway smooth muscle during breathing. We used the latch regulation scheme of Hai and Murphy (Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 255:C86-C94, 1988) integrated with Huxley's sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. This analysis showed that imposed length fluctuations decrease the mean number of attached bridges, depress muscle force and stiffness, and increase force-length hysteresis. At frequencies >0.1 Hz, the bond-length distribution of slowly cycling latch bridges changed little over the stretch cycle and contributed almost elastically to muscle force, but the rapidly cycling cross-bridge distribution changed substantially and dominated the hysteresis. By contrast, at frequencies <0.033 Hz this behavior was reversed: the rapid cycling cross-bridge distribution changed little, effectively functioning as a constant force generator, while the latch bridge bond distribution changed substantially and dominated the stiffness and hysteresis. The analysis showed the dissociation of force/length hysteresis and cross-bridge cycling rates when strain amplitude exceeds 3%; that is, there is only a weak coupling between net external mechanical work and the ATP consumption required for cycling cross-bridges during the oscillatory steady state. Although these results are specific to airway smooth muscle, the approach generalizes to other smooth muscles subjected to cyclic length fluctuations.","Srboljub M. Mijailovich, James P.

The paper presents a mathematical model for understanding chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the interaction between the cancer cells and T cells. The model takes into account the growth and death rates of both CML cells and T cells, as well as the interactions between them. The simulation results indicate that the immune response from T cells can significantly reduce the number of CML cells, but it is not sufficient to completely eliminate them. The study suggests that therapies targeting both CML cells and the immune system may be required for effective treatment.","Helen Moore & Natasha K. Li.

Morris-Lecar-1981,"Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.","C.

Niederer-Hunter-Smith-2006,"The determinants of relaxation in cardiac muscle are poorly understood, yet compromised relaxation accompanies various pathologies and impaired pump function. In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate the relative importance of the [Ca(2+)](i) transient magnitude, the unbinding of Ca(2+) from troponin C (TnC), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca(2+) sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca(2+) to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca(2+), isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca(2+)](i) transient and the unbinding of Ca(2+) from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca(2+) to TnC and length-dependent Ca(2+) sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca(2+)](i) transient and the unbinding rate of Ca(2+) from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca(2+)](i) transient and unbinding rate.","S.A.

Niederer-Smith-2007,"We developed a model of the rat ventricular myocyte at room temperature to predict the relative effects of different mechanisms on the cause of the slow increase in force in response to a step change in muscle length. We performed simulations in the presence of stretch-dependent increases in flux through the Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE) and [Formula: see text] exchanger (AE), stretch-activated channels (SAC), and the stretch-dependent nitric oxide (NO) induced increased open probability of the ryanodine receptors to estimate the capacity of each mechanism to produce the slow force response (SFR). Inclusion of stretch-dependent NHE & AE, SACs, and stretch-dependent NO effects caused an increase in tension following 15 min of stretch of 0.87%, 32%, and 0%, respectively. Comparing [Ca(2+)](i) dynamics before and after stretch in the presence of combinations of the three stretch-dependent elements, which produced significant SFR values (>20%), showed that the inclusion of stretch-dependent NO effects produced [Ca(2+)](i) transients, which were not consistent with experimental results. Further simulations showed that in the presence of SACs and the absence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE inhibition of NHE attenuated the SFR, such that reduced SFR in the presence of NHE blockers does not indicate a stretch dependence of NHE. Rather, a functioning NHE is responsible for a portion of the SFR. Based on our simulations we estimate that in rat cardiac myocytes at room temperature SACs play a significant role in producing the SFR, potentially in the presence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE and that NO effects, if any, must involve more mechanisms than just increasing the open probability of ryanodine receptors.","Steven A.

Despite its possible implications for a proper understanding of basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(−) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (−) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage.

Pandit-Giles-Demir-2003,"Our mathematical model of the rat ventricular myocyte (Pandit et al., 2001) was utilized to explore the ionic mechanism(s) that underlie the altered electrophysiological characteristics associated with the short-term model of streptozotocin-induced, type-I diabetes. The simulations show that the observed reductions in the Ca(2+)-independent transient outward K(+) current (I(t)) and the steady-state outward K(+) current (I(ss)), along with slowed inactivation of the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)), can result in the prolongation of the action potential duration, a well-known experimental finding. In addition, the model demonstrates that the slowed reactivation kinetics of I(t) in diabetic myocytes can account for the more pronounced rate-dependent action potential duration prolongation in diabetes, and that a decrease in the electrogenic Na(+)-K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) results in a small depolarization in the resting membrane potential (V(rest)). This depolarization reduces the availability of the Na(+) channels (I(Na)), thereby resulting in a slower upstroke (dV/dt(max)) of the diabetic action potential. Additional simulations suggest that a reduction in the magnitude of I(CaL), in combination with impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake can lead to a decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load. These factors contribute to characteristic abnormal [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis (reduced peak systolic value and rate of decay) in myocytes from diabetic animals. In combination, these simulation results provide novel information and integrative insights concerning plausible ionic mechanisms for the observed changes in cardiac repolarization and excitation-contraction coupling in rat ventricular myocytes in the setting of streptozotocin-induced, type-I diabetes.","Sandeep V.

Pedersen-Bertram-Sherman-2005,"Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is pulsatile with a period of 5–10 min and is believed to be responsible for plasma insulin oscillations with similar frequency. To observe an overall oscillatory insulin profile it is necessary that the insulin secretion from individual β-cells is synchronized within islets, and that the population of islets is also synchronized. We have recently developed a model in which pulsatile insulin secretion is produced as a result of calcium-driven electrical oscillations in combination with oscillations in glycolysis. We use this model to investigate possible mechanisms for intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization. We show that electrical coupling is sufficient to synchronize both electrical bursting activity and metabolic oscillations. We also demonstrate that islets can synchronize by mutually entraining each other by their effects on a simple model “liver,” which responds to the level of insulin secretion by adjusting the blood glucose concentration in an appropriate way. Since all islets are exposed to the blood, the distributed islet-liver system can synchronize the individual islet insulin oscillations. Thus, we demonstrate how intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization of insulin oscillations may be achieved.","Morten Gram Pedersen, Richard Bertram & Arthur Sherman.

Proctor-Tsiringotis-Gray-2007,"BACKGROUND: The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for homeostatic degradation of intact protein substrates as well as the elimination of damaged or misfolded proteins that might otherwise aggregate. During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML). Simulations are carried out on the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation) system and the model output is compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under various conditions. The model can be used to predict the effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation. RESULTS: The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different conditions. However, our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under conditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics. CONCLUSION: We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. Using SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process.","Carole J Proctor, Maria Tsirigotis & Douglas A Gray.

Among these processes, metabolic alterations seem to play an important role. RESULTS: We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, altering the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasmic NADP(H) pool. Remarkably, another key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is known to be inactivated in response to various oxidant treatments, and we show that this provokes a similar redirection of the metabolic flux. CONCLUSION: The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative stress. As a consequence, altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells under stress conditions.","Markus Ralser, Mirjam M Wamelink, Axel Kowald, Birgit Gerisch, Gino Heeren, Eduard A Struys, Edda Klipp, Cornelis Jakobs, Michael Breitenbach, Hans Lehrach & Sylvia Krobitsch.

Razumova-Bukatina-Campbell-2000,"Cooperativity in contractile behavior of myofilament systems almost assuredly arises because of interactions between neighboring sites. These interactions may be of different kinds. Tropomyosin thin-filament regulatory units may have neighbors in steric blocking positions (off) or steric permissive positions (on). The position of these neighbors influence the tendency for the regulatory unit to assume the on or off state. Likewise, the tendency of a myosin cross-bridge to achieve a force-bearing state may be influenced by whether neighboring cross-bridges are in force-bearing states. Also, a cross-bridge in the force-bearing state may influence the tendency of a regulatory unit to enter the on state. We used a mathematical model to examine the influence of each of these three kinds of neighbor interactions on the steady-state force-pCa relation and on the dynamic force redevelopment process. Each neighbor interaction was unique in its effects on maximal Ca(2+)-activated force, position, and symmetry of the force-pCa curve and on the Hill coefficient. Also, each neighbor interaction had a distinctive effect on the time course of force development as assessed by its rate coefficient, k(dev). These diverse effects suggest that variations in all three kinds of nearest-neighbor interactions may be responsible for a wide variety of currently unexplained observations of myofilament contractile behavior.","Maria V.

Heinz (1978. Mechanics and Engergetics of Biological Transport. Springer-Verlag, Berlin) with the assumption of equilibrium binding and 1:1 stoichiometry. Competitive binding and transport of NH+4 is included within this model. Ion affinities and permeation velocities were selected in a least-squares fit to the kinetic parameters determined experimentally in renal membrane vesicles (Aronson, P.S., M.A. Suhm, and J. Nee. 1983. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 258:6767-6771). The modifier role of internal H+ to enhance transport beyond the expected kinetics (Aronson, P.S., J. Nee, and M. A. Suhm. 1982. Nature. 299:161-163) is represented as a velocity effect of H+ binding to a single site. This kinetic formulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter was incorporated within a model of the rat proximal tubule (Weinstein, A. M. 1994. American Journal of Physiology. 267:F237-F248) as a replacement for the representation by linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics (NET). The membrane density of the antiporter was selected to yield agreement with the rate of tubular Na+ reabsorption. Simulation of 0.5 cm of tubule predicts that the activity of the Na+/H+ antiporter is the most important force for active secretion of ammonia. Model calculations of metabolic acid-base disturbances are performed and comparison is made among antiporter representations (kinetic model, kinetic model without internal modifier, and NET formulation). It is found that the ability to sharply turn off Na+/H+ exchange in cellular alkalosis substantially eliminates the cell volume increase associated with high HCO3- conditions. In the tubule model, diminished Na+/H+ exchange in alkalosis blunts the axial decrease in luminal HCO3- and thus diminishes paracellular reabsorption of Cl-. In this way, the kinetics of the Na+/H+ antiporter could act to enhance distal delivery of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3- in acute metabolic alkalosis.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n  \n\nA kinetically defined Na+/H+ antiporter within a mathematical model of the rat proximal tubule, A.M.

The paper proposes a dynamic model for HIV-1 therapy using a virus to fight against the virus. It discusses the use of genetically modified viruses to target and kill HIV-1 infected cells. The model demonstrates how this approach can lead to the eradication of HIV-1 from the body by using a combination of therapeutic agents that target both actively replicating virus and infected cells. The study highlights the potential of mathematical modeling in designing effective HIV-1 therapy.","Tomás Revilla & Gisela Garcı́a-Ramos.

Rice-Wang-Bers-de-Tombe-2008,"We develop a point model of the cardiac myofilament (MF) to simulate a wide variety of experimental muscle characterizations including Force-Ca relations and twitches under isometric, isosarcometric, isotonic, and auxotonic conditions. Complex MF behaviors are difficult to model because spatial interactions cannot be directly implemented as ordinary differential equations. We therefore allow phenomenological approximations with careful consideration to the relationships with the underlying biophysical mechanisms. We describe new formulations that avoid mean-field approximations found in most existing MF models. To increase the scope and applicability of the model, we include length- and temperature-dependent effects that play important roles in MF responses. We have also included a representation of passive restoring forces to simulate isolated cell shortening protocols. Possessing both computational efficiency and the ability to simulate a wide variety of muscle responses, the MF representation is well suited for coupling to existing cardiac cell models of electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms. To illustrate this suitability, the MF model is coupled to the Chicago rabbit cardiomyocyte model. The combined model generates realistic appearing action potentials, intracellular Ca transients, and cell shortening signals. The combined model also demonstrates that the feedback effects of force on Ca binding to troponin can modify the cytosolic Ca transient.","John Jeremy Rice, Fei Wang, Donald M.

The paper presents a mathematical model of two oscillators that describe the regulation of the cell cycle. The two oscillators are coupled in such a way that they alternate in driving the successive phases of the cell cycle. The model exhibits alternating oscillations, where one oscillator drives one phase of the cell cycle and then switches off while the other oscillator takes over. The model also exhibits chaotic behavior, where the oscillations become irregular and unpredictable. The authors suggest that the alternating behavior of the oscillators may be important for the proper regulation of the cell cycle, and that the model may be a useful tool for studying the mechanisms behind this regulation.","PIERRE-CHARLES ROMOND, MAURO RUSTICI, DIDIER GONZE & ALBERT GOLDBETER.

Rong-Perelson-2009,"Although potent combination therapy is usually able to suppress plasma viral loads in HIV-1 patients to below the detection limit of conventional clinical assays, a low level of viremia frequently can be detected in plasma by more sensitive assays. Additionally, many patients experience transient episodes of viremia above the detection limit, termed viral blips, even after being on highly suppressive therapy for many years. An obstacle to viral eradication is the persistence of a latent reservoir for HIV-1 in resting memory CD4(+) T cells. The mechanisms underlying low viral load persistence, slow decay of the latent reservoir, and intermittent viral blips are not fully characterized. The quantitative contributions of residual viral replication to viral and the latent reservoir persistence remain unclear. In this paper, we probe these issues by developing a mathematical model that considers latently infected cell activation in response to stochastic antigenic stimulation. We demonstrate that programmed expansion and contraction of latently infected cells upon immune activation can generate both low-level persistent viremia and intermittent viral blips. Also, a small fraction of activated T cells revert to latency, providing a potential to replenish the latent reservoir. By this means, occasional activation of latently infected cells can explain the variable decay characteristics of the latent reservoir observed in different clinical studies. Finally, we propose a phenomenological model that includes a logistic term representing homeostatic proliferation of latently infected cells. The model is simple but can robustly generate the multiphasic viral decline seen after initiation of therapy, as well as low-level persistent viremia and intermittent HIV-1 blips. Using these models, we provide a quantitative and integrated prospective into the long-term dynamics of HIV-1 and the latent reservoir in the setting of potent antiretroviral therapy.","Libin Rong & Alan S.

Rubin-Shevtsova-Ermentrout-Smith-Rybak-2009,"The three-phase respiratory pattern observed during normal breathing changes with alterations in metabolic or physiological conditions. A recent study using in situ perfused rat brain preparations demonstrated a reorganization of the respiratory pattern with sequential reduction of the brain stem respiratory network. Specifically, with removal of the pons, the normal three-phase pattern transformed to a two-phase inspiratory–expiratory pattern and, with more caudal transections, to one-phase, intrinsically generated inspiratory oscillations. A minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically participates in the expiratory–inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast–slow decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that, although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst generation. Our results provide important insights for understanding the state-dependent mechanisms for respiratory rhythm generation and control.","Jonathan E. Rubin, Natalia A. Shevtsova, G.

Saftenku-Williams-Sitsapesan-2001,"The modal gating behavior of single sheep cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-release/ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels was assessed. We find that the gating of RyR channels spontaneously shifts between high (H) and low (L) levels of activity and inactive periods where no channel openings are detected (I). Moreover, we find that there is evidence for multiple gating modes within H activity, which we term H1 and H2 mode. Our results demonstrate that the underlying mechanisms regulating gating are similar in native and purified channels. Dwell-time distributions of L activity were best fitted by three open and five closed significant exponential components whereas dwell-time distributions of H1 activity were best fitted by two to three open and four closed significant exponential components. Increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] cause an increase in open probability (Po) within L activity and an increase in the probability of occurrence of H activity. Open lifetime distributions within L activity were Ca2+ independent whereas open lifetime distributions within H activity were Ca2+ dependent. This study is the first attempt to estimate RyR single-channel kinetic parameters from sequences of idealized dwell-times and to develop kinetic models of RyR gating using the criterion of maximum likelihood. We propose distinct kinetic schemes for L, H1, and H2 activity that describe the major features of sheep cardiac RyR channel gating at these levels of activity.","Elena Saftenku, Alan J.

The model includes the following novel features: 1), the addition of a subsarcolemmal compartment to the other two commonly formulated cytosolic compartments (junctional and bulk) because ion channels in the membrane sense ion concentrations that differ from bulk; 2), the use of realistic cytosolic Ca buffering parameters; 3), a reversible sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca pump; 4), a scheme for Na-Ca exchange transport that is [Na](i) dependent and allosterically regulated by [Ca](i); and 5), a practical model of SR Ca release including both inactivation/adaptation and SR Ca load dependence. The data describe normal electrical activity and Ca handling characteristics of the cardiac myocyte and the SR Ca load dependence of these processes.

We construct a model of the IP(3) receptor and fit the model to dynamic and steady-state experimental data from type-2 IP(3) receptors. Our results indicate that, (i) Ca(2+) binds to the receptor using saturating, not mass-action, kinetics; (ii) Ca(2+) decreases the rate of IP(3) binding while simultaneously increasing the steady-state sensitivity of the receptor to IP(3); (iii) the rate of Ca(2+)-induced receptor activation increases with Ca(2+) and is faster than Ca(2+)-induced receptor inactivation; and (iv) IP(3) receptors are sequentially activated and inactivated by Ca(2+) even when IP(3) is bound.

Sneyd-Tsaneva-Atanasova-Yule-Thompson-Shuttleworth-2004,"It is known that Ca(2+) influx plays an important role in the modulation of inositol trisphosphate-generated Ca(2+) oscillations, but controversy over the mechanisms underlying these effects exists. In addition, the effects of blocking membrane transport or reducing Ca(2+) entry vary from one cell type to another; in some cell types oscillations persist in the absence of Ca(2+) entry (although their frequency is affected), whereas in other cell types oscillations depend on Ca(2+) entry. We present theoretical and experimental evidence that membrane transport can control oscillations by controlling the total amount of Ca(2+) in the cell (the Ca(2+) load). Our model predicts that the cell can be balanced at a point where small changes in the Ca(2+) load can move the cell into or out of oscillatory regions, resulting in the appearance or disappearance of oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are verified by experimental results from HEK293 cells. We predict that the role of Ca(2+) influx during an oscillation is to replenish the Ca(2+) load of the cell. Despite this prediction, even during the peak of an oscillation the cell or the endoplasmic reticulum may not be measurably depleted of Ca(2+).","J. Sneyd, K. Tsaneva-Atanasova, D. I. Yule, J. L.

Stern-Song-Sham-Yang-Boheler-Rios-1999,"In cardiac muscle, release of activator calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs by calcium- induced calcium release through ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are clustered in a dense, regular, two-dimensional lattice array at the diad junction. We simulated numerically the stochastic dynamics of RyRs and L-type sarcolemmal calcium channels interacting via calcium nano-domains in the junctional cleft. Four putative RyR gating schemes based on single-channel measurements in lipid bilayers all failed to give stable excitation–contraction coupling, due either to insufficiently strong inactivation to terminate locally regenerative calcium-induced calcium release or insufficient cooperativity to discriminate against RyR activation by background calcium. If the ryanodine receptor was represented, instead, by a phenomenological four-state gating scheme, with channel opening resulting from simultaneous binding of two Ca(2+) ions, and either calcium-dependent or activation-linked inactivation, the simulations gave a good semiquantitative accounting for the macroscopic features of excitation–contraction coupling. It was possible to restore stability to a model based on a bilayer-derived gating scheme, by introducing allosteric interactions between nearest-neighbor RyRs so as to stabilize the inactivated state and produce cooperativity among calcium binding sites on different RyRs. Such allosteric coupling between RyRs may be a function of the foot process and lattice array, explaining their conservation during evolution.","Michael D.

Sveiczer-Csikasz-Nagy-Gyorffy-Tyson-Novak-2000,"A detailed mathematical model for the fission yeast mitotic cycle is developed based on positive and negative feedback loops by which Cdc13/Cdc2 kinase activates and inactivates itself. Positive feedbacks are created by Cdc13/Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of specific substrates: inactivating its negative regulators (Rum1, Ste9 and Wee1/Mik1) and activating its positive regulator (Cdc25). A slow negative feedback loop is turned on during mitosis by activation of Slp1/anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which indirectly re-activates the negative regulators, leading to a drop in Cdc13/Cdc2 activity and exit from mitosis. The model explains how fission yeast cells can exit mitosis in the absence of Ste9 (Cdc13 degradation) and Rum1 (an inhibitor of Cdc13/Cdc2). We also show that, if the positive feedback loops accelerating the G(2)/M transition (through Wee1 and Cdc25) are weak, then cells can reset back to G(2) from early stages of mitosis by premature activation of the negative feedback loop. This resetting can happen more than once, resulting in a quantized distribution of cycle times, as observed experimentally in wee1(−) cdc25Δ mutant cells. Our quantitative description of these quantized cycles demonstrates the utility of mathematical modeling, because these cycles cannot be understood by intuitive arguments alone.","Akos Sveiczer, Attila Csikasz-Nagy, Bela Gyorffy, John J.

Tabak-Mascagni-Bertram-2010,"Spontaneous episodic activity is a fundamental mode of operation of developing networks. Surprisingly, the duration of an episode of activity correlates with the length of the silent interval that precedes it, but not with the interval that follows. Here we use a modeling approach to explain this characteristic, but thus far unexplained, feature of developing networks. Because the correlation pattern is observed in networks with different structures and components, a satisfactory model needs to generate the right pattern of activity regardless of the details of network architecture or individual cell properties. We thus developed simple models incorporating excitatory coupling between heterogeneous neurons and activity-dependent synaptic depression. These models robustly generated episodic activity with the correct correlation pattern. The correlation pattern resulted from episodes being triggered at random levels of recovery from depression while they terminated around the same level of depression. To explain this fundamental difference between episode onset and termination, we used a mean field model, where only average activity and average level of recovery from synaptic depression are considered. In this model, episode onset is highly sensitive to inputs. Thus noise resulting from random coincidences in the spike times of individual neurons led to the high variability at episode onset and to the observed correlation pattern. This work further shows that networks with widely different architectures, different cell types, and different functions all operate according to the same general mechanism early in their development.","Joël Tabak, Michael Mascagni & Richard Bertram.

Tabak-Toporikova-Freeman-Bertram-2007,"Dopamine (DA) released from the hypothalamus tonically inhibits pituitary lactotrophs. DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations ~1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K(+) current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K(+) currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both I(BK) and I(A) could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. I(BK) always increased the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, while I(A) could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K(+) conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that a heterogeneous distribution of fast K(+) conductances could cause heterogeneous lactotroph firing patterns.","Joël Tabak, Natalia Toporikova, Marc E.

Tong-Choi-Kharche-Holden-Zhang-Taggart-2011,"Uterine contractions during labor are discretely regulated by rhythmic action potentials (AP) of varying duration and form that serve to determine calcium-dependent force production. We have employed a computational biology approach to develop a fuller understanding of the complexity of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling of uterine smooth muscle cells (USMC). Our overall aim is to establish a mathematical platform of sufficient biophysical detail to quantitatively describe known uterine E-C coupling parameters and thereby inform future empirical investigations of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms governing normal and dysfunctional labors. From published and unpublished data we construct mathematical models for fourteen ionic currents of USMCs: [Image: see text] currents (L- and T-type), [Image: see text] current, an hyperpolarization-activated current, three voltage-gated [Image: see text] currents, two [Image: see text]-activated [Image: see text] current, [Image: see text]-activated [Image: see text] current, non-specific cation current, [Image: see text]-[Image: see text] exchanger, [Image: see text]-[Image: see text] pump and background current. The magnitudes and kinetics of each current system in a spindle shaped single cell with a specified surface area∶volume ratio is described by differential equations, in terms of maximal conductances, electrochemical gradient, voltage-dependent activation/inactivation gating variables and temporal changes in intracellular [Image: see text] computed from known [Image: see text] fluxes. These quantifications are validated by the reconstruction of the individual experimental ionic currents obtained under voltage-clamp. Phasic contraction is modeled in relation to the time constant of changing [Image: see text].

Tong-Tribe-Smith-Taggart-2014,"The electrical excitability of uterine smooth muscle cells is a key determinant of the contraction of the organ during labor and is manifested by spontaneous, periodic action potentials (APs). Near the end of term, APs vary in shape and size reflecting an ability to change the frequency, duration and amplitude of uterine contractions. A recent mathematical model quantified several ionic features of the electrical excitability in uterine smooth muscle cells. It replicated many of the experimentally recorded uterine AP configurations but its limitations were evident when trying to simulate the long-duration bursting APs characteristic of labor. A computational parameter search suggested that delayed rectifying K(+) currents could be a key model component requiring improvement to produce the longer-lasting bursting APs. Of the delayed rectifying K(+) currents family it is of interest that KCNQ and hERG channels have been reported to be gestationally regulated in the uterus. These currents exhibit features similar to the broadly defined uterine I (K1) of the original mathematical model. We thus formulated new quantitative descriptions for several I (KCNQ) and I (hERG). Incorporation of these currents into the uterine cell model enabled simulations of the long-lasting bursting APs. Moreover, we used this modified model to simulate the effects of different contributions of I (KCNQ) and I (hERG) on AP form. Our findings suggest that the alterations in expression of hERG and KCNQ channels can potentially provide a mechanism for fine tuning of AP forms that lends a malleability for changing between plateau-like and long-lasting bursting-type APs as uterine cells prepare for parturition.","Wing-Chiu Tong, Rachel M.

Tran-2010,"We present a metabolically regulated model of cardiac active force generation with which we investigate the effects of ischemia on maximum force production. Our model, based on a model of cross-bridge kinetics that was developed by others, reproduces many of the observed effects of MgATP, MgADP, Pi, and H(+) on force development while retaining the force/length/Ca(2+) properties of the original model. We introduce three new parameters to account for the competitive binding of H(+) to the Ca(2+) binding site on troponin C and the binding of MgADP within the cross-bridge cycle. These parameters, along with the Pi and H(+) regulatory steps within the cross-bridge cycle, were constrained using data from the literature and validated using a range of metabolic and sinusoidal length perturbation protocols. The placement of the MgADP binding step between two strongly-bound and force-generating states leads to the emergence of an unexpected effect on the force-MgADP curve, where the trend of the relationship (positive or negative) depends on the concentrations of the other metabolites and [H(+)].

The SERCA model consists of a number of sub-states with partial reactions that are sensitive to Ca(2+) and pH, and to the metabolites MgATP, MgADP, and Pi. Optimization of model parameters to fit experimental data favors a fully cooperative Ca(2+)-binding mechanism and predicts a Ca(2+)/H(+) counter-transport stoichiometry of 2. Moreover, the order of binding of the partial reactions, particularly the binding of MgATP, proves to be a strong determinant of the ability of the model to fit the data.

Tyson-1991,"The proteins cdc2 and cyclin form a heterodimer (maturation promoting factor) that controls the major events of the cell cycle. A mathematical model for the interactions of cdc2 and cyclin is constructed. Simulation and analysis of the model show that the control system can operate in three modes: as a steady state with high maturation promoting factor activity, as a spontaneous oscillator, or as an excitable switch. We associate the steady state with metaphase arrest in unfertilized eggs, the spontaneous oscillations with rapid division cycles in early embryos, and the excitable switch with growth-controlled division cycles typical of nonembryonic cells.","J J Tyson.

The paper describes a computer simulation of arrhythmias in a network of coupled excitable elements, such as cardiac muscle cells. The authors developed a mathematical model of excitable elements that included parameters like refractory period and membrane potential. They then used this model to simulate the behavior of a network of such elements under various conditions, such as different coupling strengths or random disturbances. The simulation results highlighted the importance of electrical coupling between cells in maintaining stable cardiac rhythm, and revealed the potential mechanisms underlying certain types of arrhythmias, like reentry.

Vasalou-Henson-2010,"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is a multicellular system that drives daily rhythms in mammalian behavior and physiology. Although the gene regulatory network that produces daily oscillations within individual neurons is well characterized, less is known about the electrophysiology of the SCN cells and how firing rate correlates with circadian gene expression. We developed a firing rate code model to incorporate known electrophysiological properties of SCN pacemaker cells, including circadian dependent changes in membrane voltage and ion conductances. Calcium dynamics were included in the model as the putative link between electrical firing and gene expression. Individual ion currents exhibited oscillatory patterns matching experimental data both in current levels and phase relationships. VIP and GABA neurotransmitters, which encode synaptic signals across the SCN, were found to play critical roles in daily oscillations of membrane excitability and gene expression. Blocking various mechanisms of intracellular calcium accumulation by simulated pharmacological agents (nimodipine, IP3- and ryanodine-blockers) reproduced experimentally observed trends in firing rate dynamics and core-clock gene transcription. The intracellular calcium concentration was shown to regulate diverse circadian processes such as firing frequency, gene expression and system periodicity. The model predicted a direct relationship between firing frequency and gene expression amplitudes, demonstrated the importance of intracellular pathways for single cell behavior and provided a novel multiscale framework which captured characteristics of the SCN at both the electrophysiological and gene regulatory levels.","Christina Vasalou & Michael A.

Vilar-Kueh-Barkai-Leibler-2002,"A wide range of organisms use circadian clocks to keep internal sense of daily time and regulate their behavior accordingly. Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements. The integration of these “circuits” at the cellular level imposes strong constraints on their functioning and design. Here, we study a recently proposed model [Barkai, N. & Leibler, S. (2000) Nature (London), 403, 267–268] that incorporates just the essential elements found experimentally. We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one. Under some conditions, this oscillator is not only resistant to but, paradoxically, also enhanced by the intrinsic biochemical noise.","José M. G.

Vinnakota-Rusk-Palmer-Shankland-Kushmeric-2010,"Rates of ATPase and glycolysis are several times faster in actively contracting mouse extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) than soleus (SOL), but we find these rates are not distinguishable at rest. We used a transient anoxic perturbation of steady state energy balance to decrease phosphocreatine (PCr) reversibly and to measure the rates of ATPase and of lactate production without muscle activation or contraction. The rate of glycolytic ATP synthesis is less than the ATPase rate, accounting for the continual PCr decrease during anoxia in both muscles. We fitted a mathematical model validated with properties of enzymes and solutes measured in vitro and appropriate for the transient perturbation of these muscles to experimental data to test whether the model accounts for the results. Simulations showed equal rates of ATPase and lactate production in both muscles. ATPase controls glycolytic flux by feedback from its products. Adenylate kinase function is critical because a rise in [AMP] is necessary to activate glycogen phosphorylase. ATPase is the primary source of H(+) production. The sum of contributions of the 13 reactions of the glycogenolytic and glycolytic network to total proton load is negligible. The stoichiometry of lactate and H(+) production is near unity. These results identify a default state of energy metabolism for resting muscle in which there is no difference in the metabolic phenotype of EDL and SOL. Therefore, additional control mechanisms, involving higher ATPase flux and [Ca(2+)], must exist to explain the well-known difference in glycolytic rates in fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles in actively contracting muscle.","Kalyan C.

Through quantitative measurements that systematically canvas an array of stimulation and molecular perturbation conditions, together with computational modeling and analysis, we have elucidated cross-talk mechanisms in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling network, in which phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways are prominently activated. We show that, while PI3K signaling is insulated from cross-talk, PI3K enhances Erk activation at points both upstream and downstream of Ras. The magnitudes of these effects depend strongly on the stimulation conditions, subject to saturation effects in the respective pathways and negative feedback loops. Motivated by those dynamics, a kinetic model of the network was formulated and used to precisely quantify the relative contributions of PI3K-dependent and -independent modes of Ras/Erk activation.","Chun‐Chao Wang, Murat Cirit & Jason M Haugh.

Wang-Sobie-2008,"Therapies for heart disease are based largely on our understanding of the adult myocardium. The dramatic differences in action potential (AP) shape between neonatal and adult cardiac myocytes, however, indicate that a different set of molecular interactions in neonatal myocytes necessitates different treatment for newborns. Computational modeling is useful for synthesizing data to determine how interactions between components lead to systems-level behavior, but this technique has not been used extensively to study neonatal heart cell function. We created a mathematical model of the neonatal (day 1) mouse myocyte by modifying, based on experimental data, the densities and/or formulations of ion transport mechanisms in an adult cell model. The new model reproduces the characteristic AP shape of neonatal cells, with a brief plateau phase and longer duration than the adult (APD(80)=60.1 vs. 12.6 ms). The simulation results are consistent with experimental data, including: 1) decreased density, and altered inactivation, of transient outward K(+) currents, 2) increased delayed rectifier K(+) currents, 3) Ca(2+) entry through T-type as well as L-type Ca(2+) channels, 4) increased Ca(2+) influx through Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange, and 5) Ca(2+) transients resulting from transmembrane Ca(2+) entry rather than release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Simulations performed with the model generated novel predictions, including increased SR Ca(2+) leak and elevated intracellular [Na(+)] in neonatal compared with adult myocytes. This new model can therefore be used for testing hypotheses and obtaining a better quantitative understanding of differences between neonatal and adult physiology.","Linda J. Wang & Eric A. Sobie.

Westermark-Lansner-2003,"We have constructed a model of the upper part of the glycolysis in the pancreatic β-cell. The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and/or GAPD activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and/or GAPD activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible.

Winograd-Destexhe-Sanchez-Vives-2008,"We describe a phenomenon of hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent activity (HAGPA) in prefrontal cortex neurons. Successive hyperpolarizing pulses induced increasingly higher rates of tonic firing that remained stable for tens of seconds, allowing the neuron to retain a memory of the previous history of stimulation. This phenomenon occurred at the cellular level and in the absence of neuromodulators. Neurons with HAGPA had a sag during hyperpolarization, and blocking h-current eliminated the sag and prevented HAGPA, suggesting that the activation of this hyperpolarization-activated cationic current was necessary for the occurrence of the phenomenon. A single-neuron biophysical model including h-current modulation by intracellular calcium was able to display HAGPA. This form of neuronal memory not only allows the transformation of inhibition into an increase of firing rate, but also endows neurons with a mechanism to compute the properties of successive inputs into persistent activity, thus solving a difficult computational problem.","Milena Winograd, Alain Destexhe & Maria V.

Wodarz-Hamer-2007,"Recent experimental data have shown that HIV specific CD4 T cells provide a very important target for HIV replication. We use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their own stimulation. We show that such auto-catalytic cell division can significantly enhance virus spread, and can also provide an additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral drug therapy. In addition, the initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their extinction. On the other hand, a low initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of HIV specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune impairment, lead to less efficient anti-viral effector responses, and thus speed up disease progression, especially if effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently boosted at the same time.","Dominik Wodarz & Dean H.

Wodarz-Nowak-1999,"We use mathematical models to study the relationship between HIV and the immune system during the natural course of infection and in the context of different antiviral treatment regimes. The models suggest that an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory response is required to control the virus. We define CTL memory as long-term persistence of CTL precursors in the absence of antigen. Infection and depletion of CD4(+) T helper cells interfere with CTL memory generation, resulting in persistent viral replication and disease progression. We find that antiviral drug therapy during primary infection can enable the development of CTL memory. In chronically infected patients, specific treatment schedules, either including deliberate drug holidays or antigenic boosts of the immune system, can lead to a re-establishment of CTL memory. Whether such treatment regimes would lead to long-term immunologic control deserves investigation under carefully controlled conditions.","Dominik Wodarz & Martin A. Nowak.

Wodarz-Sierro-Klenerman-2007,"Upon acute viral infection, a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles at a relatively stable memory level. Recently, experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had resolved, some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as ‘CTL memory inflation’. In order to examine the dynamics of this system further, we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this model, a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer (NK) cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute infection, but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific CD8+T cells seen in humans as they age.","Dominik Wodarz, Sophie Sierro & Paul Klenerman.

Yates-Stark-Klein-Antia-Callard-2007,"BACKGROUND: The asymptomatic phase of HIV infection is characterised by a slow decline of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells. Why this decline is slow is not understood. One potential explanation is that the low average rate of homeostatic proliferation or immune activation dictates the pace of a “runaway” decline of memory CD4(+) T cells, in which activation drives infection, higher viral loads, more recruitment of cells into an activated state, and further infection events. We explore this hypothesis using mathematical models. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using simple mathematical models of the dynamics of T cell homeostasis and proliferation, we find that this mechanism fails to explain the time scale of CD4(+) memory T cell loss. Instead it predicts the rapid attainment of a stable set point, so other mechanisms must be invoked to explain the slow decline in CD4(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: A runaway cycle in which elevated CD4(+) T cell activation and proliferation drive HIV production and vice versa cannot explain the pace of depletion during chronic HIV infection. We summarize some alternative mechanisms by which the CD4(+) memory T cell homeostatic set point might slowly diminish. While none are mutually exclusive, the phenomenon of viral rebound, in which interruption of antiretroviral therapy causes a rapid return to pretreatment viral load and T cell counts, supports the model of virus adaptation as a major force driving depletion.","Andrew Yates, Jaroslav Stark, Nigel Klein, Rustom Antia & Robin Callard.
