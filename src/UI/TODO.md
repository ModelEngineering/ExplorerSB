## List of potential improvements

- On the main page, add a button that takes you to a page that displays all models.
- Mobile optimized searchbar: Make the searchbar shrink to a search button that only appears when clicked on.
- Add a share button that copies the link of the current model into the clipboard.
- The dropdown menus: currently there are two libraries being used for the dropdown menus, it would be nice to unify the interface in some way.
