        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Qualitative frameworks, especially those based on the logical discrete formalism, are increasingly used to model regulatory and signalling networks. A major advantage of these frameworks is that they do not require precise quantitative data, and that they are well-suited for studies of large networks. While numerous groups have developed specific computational tools that provide original methods to analyse qualitative models, a standard format to exchange qualitative models has been missing. RESULTS: We present the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Qualitative Models Package (\u201cqual\u201d), an extension of the SBML Level 3 standard designed for computer representation of qualitative models of biological networks. We demonstrate the interoperability of models via SBML qual through the analysis of a specific signalling network by three independent software tools. Furthermore, the collective effort to define the SBML qual format paved the way for the development of LogicalModel, an open-source model library, which will facilitate the adoption of the format as well as the collaborative development of algorithms to analyse qualitative models. CONCLUSIONS: SBML qual allows the exchange of qualitative models among a number of complementary software tools. SBML qual has the potential to promote collaborative work on the development of novel computational approaches, as well as on the specification and the analysis of comprehensive qualitative models of regulatory and signalling networks.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software. RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function; however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance, COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an object-oriented framework designed to meet the computational challenges associated with the next generation of stoichiometric constraint-based models and high-density omics data sets.

        "abstract":"Computational models are increasingly important for studying complex neurophysiological systems. As scientific tools, it is essential that such models can be reproduced and critically evaluated by a range of scientists. However, published models are currently implemented using a diverse set of modeling approaches, simulation tools, and computer languages making them inaccessible and difficult to reproduce. Models also typically contain concepts that are tightly linked to domain-specific simulators, or depend on knowledge that is described exclusively in text-based documentation. To address these issues we have developed a compact, hierarchical, XML-based language called LEMS (Low Entropy Model Specification), that can define the structure and dynamics of a wide range of biological models in a fully machine readable format. We describe how LEMS underpins the latest version of NeuroML and show that this framework can define models of ion channels, synapses, neurons and networks. Unit handling, often a source of error when reusing models, is built into the core of the language by specifying physical quantities in models in terms of the base dimensions. We show how LEMS, together with the open source Java and Python based libraries we have developed, facilitates the generation of scripts for multiple neuronal simulators and provides a route for simulator free code generation. We establish that LEMS can be used to define models from systems biology and map them to neuroscience-domain specific simulators, enabling models to be shared between these traditionally separate disciplines. LEMS and NeuroML 2 provide a new, comprehensive framework for defining computational models of neuronal and other biological systems in a machine readable format, making them more reproducible and increasing the transparency and accessibility of their underlying structure and properties.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential element of most living organisms but is a dangerous substance when poorly liganded in solution. The hormone hepcidin regulates the export of iron from tissues to the plasma contributing to iron homeostasis and also restricting its availability to infectious agents. Disruption of iron regulation in mammals leads to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and contributes to the etiology of several other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that hepcidin alone is able to regulate iron distribution in different dietary regimes in the mouse using a computational model of iron distribution calibrated with radioiron tracer data. RESULTS: A model was developed and calibrated to the data from adequate iron diet, which was able to simulate the iron distribution under a low iron diet. However simulation of high iron diet shows considerable deviations from the experimental data. Namely the model predicts more iron in red blood cells and less iron in the liver than what was observed in experiments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hepcidin alone is not sufficient to regulate iron homeostasis in high iron conditions and that other factors are important. The model was able to simulate anemia when hepcidin was increased but was unable to simulate hemochromatosis when hepcidin was suppressed, suggesting that in high iron conditions additional regulatory interactions are important.

Early CellML-based environments include COR and OpenCell. However, both of those tools have limitations and were eventually replaced with OpenCOR (opencor.ws). OpenCOR is an open source modeling environment that is supported on Windows, Linux and OS X. It relies on a modular approach, which means that all of its features come in the form of plugins. Those plugins can be used to organize, edit, simulate and analyze models encoded in the CellML format. We start with an introduction to CellML and two of its early adopters, which limitations eventually led to the development of OpenCOR. We then go onto describing the general philosophy behind OpenCOR, as well as describing its openness and its development process. Next, we illustrate various aspects of OpenCOR, such as its user interface and some of the plugins that come bundled with it (e.g., its editing and simulation plugins). Finally, we discuss some of the advantages and limitations of OpenCOR before drawing some concluding remarks.",

However, why and how Ca(2+) oscillation regulates NFAT activity remain elusive. NFAT is dephosphorylated by Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to initiate transcription. We analyzed the kinetics of dephosphorylation and translocation of NFAT. We show that Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphoryl ation proceeds rapidly, while the rephosphorylation and nuclear transport of NFAT proceed slowly. Therefore, after brief Ca(2+) stimulation, dephosphoryl ated NFAT has a lifetime of several minutes in the cytoplasm. Thus, Ca(2+) oscillation induces a build-up of dephosphorylated NFAT in the cytoplasm, allowing effective nuclear translocation, provided that the oscillation interval is shorter than the lifetime of dephos phorylated NFAT. We also show that Ca(2+) oscillation is more cost-effective in inducing the translocation of NFAT than continuous Ca(2+) signaling. Thus, the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT functions as a working memory of Ca(2+) signals and enables the control of NFAT nuclear translocation by the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillation at a reduced cost of Ca(2+) signaling.",

        "abstract":"A kinetic model that links conformational interconversion rates to agonist binding and extends the general principles of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric transitions. The crucial assumption is that the linkage is controlled by the position of the interconversion transition states on a hypothetical linear reaction coordinate. Application of the model to the peripheral nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) accounts for the main properties of ligand-gating, including single-channel events, and several new relationships are predicted. Kinetic simulations reveal errors inherent in using the dose-response analysis, but justify its application under defined conditions. The model predicts that (in order to overcome the intrinsic stability of the B state and to produce the appropriate cooperativity) channel activation is driven by an A state with a Kd in the 50 nM range, hence some 140-fold stronger than the apparent affinity of the open state deduced previously. According to the model, recovery from the desensitized states may occur via rapid transit through the A state with minimal channel opening, thus without necessarily undergoing a distinct recovery pathway, as assumed in the standard 'cycle' model. Transitions to the desensitized states by low concentration 'pre-pulses' are predicted to occur without significant channel opening, but equilibrium values of IC50 can be obtained only with long pre-pulse times. Predictions are also made concerning allosteric effectors and their possible role in coincidence detection.",

In this study, we have created an integrated stochastic model of DNA damage repair by non-homologous end joining and of gamma irradiation-induced cellular senescence in human cells that are not apoptosis-prone. The integrated model successfully explains the changes that occur in the dynamics of DNA damage repair after irradiation. Simulations of p53\/p21 dynamics after irradiation agree well with previously published experimental studies, further validating the model. Additionally, the model predicts, and we offer some experimental support, that low-dose fractionated irradiation of cells leads to temporal patterns in p53\/p21 that lead to significant cellular senescence.

        "abstract":"The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signalling network is an evolutionarily conserved network that controls key cellular processes, including cell growth and metabolism. Consisting of the major kinase complexes mTOR Complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1\/2), the mTOR network harbours complex interactions and feedback loops. The DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) was recently identified as an endogenous inhibitor of both mTORC1 and 2 through direct interactions, and is in turn degraded by mTORC1\/2, adding an extra layer of complexity to the mTOR network. Yet, the dynamic properties of the DEPTOR-mTOR network and the roles of DEPTOR in coordinating mTORC1\/2 activation dynamics have not been characterised. Using computational modelling, systems analysis and dynamic simulations we show that DEPTOR confers remarkably rich and complex dynamic behaviours to mTOR signalling, including abrupt, bistable switches, oscillations and co-existing bistable\/oscillatory responses. Transitions between these distinct modes of behaviour are enabled by modulating DEPTOR expression alone. We characterise the governing conditions for the observed dynamics by elucidating the network in its vast multi-dimensional parameter space, and develop strategies to identify core network design motifs underlying these dynamics. Our findings provide new systems-level insights into the complexity of mTOR signalling contributed by DEPTOR.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The development of high-throughput technologies capable of whole cell measurements of genes, proteins, and metabolites has led to the emergence of systems biology. Integrated analysis of the resulting omic data sets has proved to be hard to achieve. Metabolic network reconstructions enable complex relationships amongst molecular components to be represented formally in a biologically relevant manner while respecting physical constraints. In silico models derived from such reconstructions can then be queried or interrogated through mathematical simulations. Proteomic profiling studies of the mature human erythrocyte have shown more proteins present related to metabolic function than previously thought; however the significance and the causal consequences of these findings have not been explored. RESULTS: Erythrocyte proteomic data was used to reconstruct the most expansive description of erythrocyte metabolism to date, following extensive manual curation, assessment of the literature, and functional testing. The reconstruction contains 281 enzymes representing functions from glycolysis to cofactor and amino acid metabolism. Such a comprehensive view of erythrocyte metabolism implicates the erythrocyte as a potential biomarker for different diseases as well as a 'cell-based' drug-screening tool. The analysis shows that 94 erythrocyte enzymes are implicated in morbid single nucleotide polymorphisms, representing 142 pathologies. In addition, over 230 FDA-approved and experimental pharmaceuticals have enzymatic targets in the erythrocyte. CONCLUSION: The advancement of proteomic technologies and increased generation of high-throughput proteomic data have created the need for a means to analyze these data in a coherent manner. Network reconstructions provide a systematic means to integrate and analyze proteomic data in a biologically meaning manner. Analysis of the red cell proteome has revealed an unexpected level of complexity in the functional capabilities of human erythrocyte metabolism.",

This updated metabolic reconstruction includes: (1) an alignment with the latest genome annotation and the metabolic content of EcoCyc leading to the inclusion of the activities of 1260 ORFs, (2) characterization and quantification of the biomass components and maintenance requirements associated with growth of E. coli and (3) thermodynamic information for the included chemical reactions. The conversion of this metabolic network reconstruction into an in silico model is detailed. A new step in the metabolic reconstruction process, termed thermodynamic consistency analysis, is introduced, in which reactions were checked for consistency with thermodynamic reversibility estimates. Applications demonstrating the capabilities of the genome-scale metabolic model to predict high-throughput experimental growth and gene deletion phenotypic screens are presented. The increased scope and computational capability using this new reconstruction is expected to broaden the spectrum of both basic biology and applied systems biology studies of E. coli metabolism.",

Here, we present an integrated approach through a systematic model-driven evaluation of the production potential for the bacterial production organism E. coli to produce multiple native products from different representative feedstocks through coupling metabolite production to growth rate. Designs were examined for eleven unique central metabolism and amino acid targets from three different substrates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Optimal strain designs were reported for designs which possess maximum yield, substrate-specific productivity, and strength of growth-coupling for up to ten reaction eliminations (knockouts). In total, growth-coupled designs could be identified for 36 out of the total 54 conditions tested, corresponding to eight out of the eleven targets. There were 17 different substrate\/target pairs for which over 80% of the theoretical maximum potential could be achieved. The developed method introduces a new concept of objective function tilting for strain design. This study provides specific metabolic interventions (strain designs) for production strains that can be experimentally implemented, characterizes the potential for E. coli to produce native compounds, and outlines a strain design pipeline that can be utilized to design production strains for additional organisms.",

The results show that unique strain-specific metabolic capabilities correspond to pathotypes and environmental niches. Twelve of the GEMs were used to predict growth on six differentiating nutrients, and the predictions were found to agree with 80% of experimental outcomes. Additionally, GEMs were used to predict strain-specific auxotrophies. Twelve of the strains modeled were predicted to be auxotrophic for vitamins niacin (vitamin B(3)), thiamin (vitamin B(1)), or folate (vitamin B(9)). Six of the strains modeled have lost biosynthetic pathways for essential amino acids methionine, tryptophan, or leucine. Genome-scale analysis of multiple strains of a species can thus be used to define the metabolic essence of a microbial species and delineate growth differences that shed light on the adaptation process to a particular microenvironment.",

Control of the cell cycle is achieved by artificially expressing a protein that reversibly binds and inactivates any one of the CDC proteins. In the simplest case, such as the checkpoint-free situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, the frequency of CDC oscillations can be increased or decreased by regulating the rate of synthesis, the binding rate, or the equilibrium constant of the binding protein. In a more complex model of cell division, where size-control checkpoints are included, we show that the same reversible binding reaction can alter the mean cell mass in a continuously dividing cell. Because this control scheme is general and requires only the expression of a single protein, it provides a practical means for tuning the characteristics of the cell cycle in vivo.",

Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus\/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus\/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.",

The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade levels, so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the response, the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell types, the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the MAPK cascades, we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost 100% of the total protein. The oscillations of the phosphorylation cascades and slow protein diffusion in the cytoplasm can lead to intracellular waves of phospho-proteins.",

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.",

The first model is the result of an attempt to construct a traditional kinetic model based on Michaelis-Menten rate laws. This attempt is only partially successful, since kinetic information, while extensive, is not complete, and since qualitative information is difficult to incorporate into this type of model. The data gaps necessitate the complementation of the Michaelis-Menten model with other functional forms that can incorporate different types of data. The most convenient and established representations for this purpose are rate laws formulated as power-law functions, and these are used to construct a Complemented Michaelis-Menten (CMM) model. The other two models are pure power-law-representations, one in the form of a Generalized Mass Action (GMA) system, and the other one in the form of an S-system. The first part of the paper contains a compendium of experimental data necessary for any model of purine metabolism. This is followed by the formulation of the three models and a comparative analysis. For physiological and moderately pathological perturbations in metabolites or enzymes, the results of the three models are very similar and consistent with clinical findings. This is an encouraging result since the three models have different structures and data requirements and are based on different mathematical assumptions. Significant enzyme deficiencies are not so well modeled by the S-system model. The CMM model captures the dynamics better, but judging by comparisons with clinical observations, the best model in this case is the GMA model. The model results are discussed in some detail, along with advantages and disadvantages of each modeling strategy.",

Here the authors demonstrate that a model of pyruvate distribution in Lactococcus lactis based on enzyme kinetics in combination with metabolic control analysis clearly indicates the key control points in the flux to acetoin and diacetyl, important flavour compounds. The model presented here (available at http:\/\/jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za\/wcfs.html) showed that the enzymes with the greatest effect on this flux resided outside the acetolactate synthase branch itself.

The schema accounts for the interconversion of highly polyglutamated tetrahydrofolate, 5-methyl-FH4, 5-10-CH2FH4, dihydrofolate (FH2), 10-formyl-FH4 (FFH4), and 10-formyl-FH2 (FFH2), as well as formation and transport of the MTX polyglutamates. Inhibition mechanisms have been chosen to reproduce all observed non-, un-, and pure competition inhibition patterns. Steady state folate concentrations and thymidylate and purine synthesis rates in drug-free intact cells were used to determine normal folate Vmax values. The resulting average-cell folate model, examined for its ability to predict folate pool behavior following exposure to 1 microM MTX over 21 h, agreed well with the experiment, including a relative preservation of the FFH4 and CH2FH4 pools. The results depend strongly on thymidylate synthase (TS) reaction mechanism, especially the assumption that MTX di- and triglutamates inhibit TS synthesis as greatly in the intact cell as they do with purified enzyme. The effects of cell cycle dependence of TS and dihydrofolate reductase activities were also examined by introducing G- to S-phase activity ratios of these enzymes into the model. For activity ratios down to at least 5%, cell population averaged folate pools were only slightly affected, while CH2FH4 pools in S-phase cells were reduced to as little as 10% of control values. Significantly, these folate pool dynamics were indicated to arise from both direct inhibition by MTX polyglutamates as well as inhibition by elevated levels of polyglutamated FH2 and FFH2.",

        "abstract":"In Drosophila, circadian oscillations in the levels of two proteins, PER and TIM, result from the negative feedback exerted by a PER-TIM complex on the expression of the per and tim genes which code for these two proteins. On the basis of these experimental observations, we have recently proposed a theoretical model for circadian oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins in Drosophila. Here we show that for constant environmental conditions this model is capable of generating autonomous chaotic oscillations. For other parameter values, the model can also display birhythmicity, i.e. the coexistence between two stable regimes of limit cycle oscillations. We analyse the occurrence of chaos and birhythmicity by means of bifurcation diagrams and locate the different domains of complex oscillatory behavior in parameter space. The relative smallness of these domains raises doubts as to the possible physiological significance of chaos and birhythmicity in regard to circadian rhythm generation. Beyond the particular context of circadian rhythms we discuss the results in the light of other mechanisms underlying chaos and birhythmicity in regulated biological systems.

After the discovery of per and tim, a model with a simple feedback loop involving per and tim has been proposed. However, it is recognized that the simple feedback model cannot account for phenotypes generated by various mutants. A recent report by Glossop, Lyons & Hardin [Science286, 766 (1999)] on Drosophila suggests involvement of another feedback loop by dClk that is interlocked with per-tim feedback loop. In order to examine whether interlocked feedback loops can be a basic mechanism for circadian rhythms, a mathematical model was created and examined. Through extensive simulation and mathematical analysis, it was revealed that the interlocked feedback model accounts for the observations that are not explained by the simple feedback model. Moreover, the interlocked feedback model has robust properties in oscillations.",

        "abstract":"Sucrose accumulation in developing sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) is accompanied by a continuous synthesis and cleavage of sucrose in the storage tissues. Despite numerous studies, the factors affecting sucrose accumulation are still poorly understood, and no consistent pattern has emerged which pinpoints certain enzyme activities as important controlling steps. Here, we develop an approach based on pathway analysis and kinetic modelling to assess the biochemical control of sucrose accumulation and futile cycling in sugar cane. By using the concept of elementary flux modes, all possible routes of futile cycling of sucrose were enumerated in the metabolic system. The available kinetic data for the pathway enzymes were then collected and assembled in a kinetic model of sucrose accumulation in sugar cane culm tissue. Although no data were fitted, the model agreed well with independent experimental results: in no case was the difference between calculated and measured fluxes and concentrations greater than 2-fold. The model thus validated was then used to assess different enhancement strategies for increasing sucrose accumulation. First, the control coefficient of each enzyme in the system on futile cycling of sucrose was calculated. Secondly, the activities of those enzymes with the numerically largest control coefficients were varied over a 5-fold range to determine the effect on the degree of futile cycling, the conversion efficiency from hexoses into sucrose, and the net sucrose accumulation rate. In view of the modelling results, overexpression of the fructose or glucose transporter or the vacuolar sucrose import protein, as well as reduction of cytosolic neutral invertase levels, appear to be the most promising targets for genetic manipulation. This offers a more directed improvement strategy than cumbersome gene-by-gene manipulation. The kinetic model can be viewed and interrogated on the World Wide Web at http:\/\/jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za.",

A key difficulty with signaling models is that, while significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these networks, many of the parameters required to describe their behavior remain unknown or at best represent estimates. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods toward modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. In particular, we study the actions of NGF and mitogenic epidermal growth factor (EGF) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Through a network of intermediate signaling proteins, each of these growth factors stimulates extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation with distinct dynamical profiles. Using our modeling approach, we are able to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems that we call 'sloppiness.'",

Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one.

Under constant conditions of illumination and temperature, these internal biological rhythms persist with a period close to 1 day (\"circadian\"), but it is usually not exactly 24h. Recent discoveries have uncovered stunning similarities among the molecular circuitries of circadian clocks in mice, fruit flies, and bread molds. A consensus picture is coming into focus around two proteins (called PER and TIM in fruit flies), which dimerize and then inhibit transcription of their own genes. Although this picture seems to confirm a venerable model of circadian rhythms based on time-delayed negative feedback, we suggest that just as crucial to the circadian oscillator is a positive feedback loop based on stabilization of PER upon dimerization. These ideas can be expressed in simple mathematical form (phase plane portraits), and the model accounts naturally for several hallmarks of circadian rhythms, including temperature compensation and the per(L) mutant phenotype. In addition, the model suggests how an endogenous circadian oscillator could have evolved from a more primitive, light-activated switch.",

By computer simulation it is now shown how and under which conditions the regulatory hierarchy of genes can be determined experimentally. A kinetic model of the sporulation control network is developed, which is then used to demonstrate how the mechanisms of TRSC can be understood and simulated at the kinetic level. On the basis of theoretical considerations, experimental parameters that determine whether functional complementation of two mutations will occur are identified. It is also shown how gene dosage-effect relationships can be employed for network analysis.

To address the issue of whether the behavior in vivo of the PTS can be understood in terms of these enzyme kinetics, a detailed kinetic model was constructed. Each overall phosphotransfer reaction was separated into two elementary reactions, the first entailing association of the phosphoryl donor and acceptor into a complex and the second entailing dissociation of the complex into dephosphorylated donor and phosphorylated acceptor. Literature data on the K(m) values and association constants of PTS proteins for their substrates, as well as equilibrium and rate constants for the overall phosphotransfer reactions, were related to the rate constants of the elementary steps in a set of equations; the rate constants could be calculated by solving these equations simultaneously. No kinetic parameters were fitted. As calculated by the model, the kinetic parameter values in vitro could describe experimental results in vivo when varying each of the PTS protein concentrations individually while keeping the other protein concentrations constant. Using the same kinetic constants, but adjusting the protein concentrations in the model to those present in cell-free extracts, the model could reproduce experiments in vitro analyzing the dependence of the flux on the total PTS protein concentration. For modeling conditions in vivo it was crucial that the PTS protein concentrations be implemented at their high in vivo values. The model suggests a new interpretation of results hitherto not understood; in vivo, the major fraction of the PTS proteins may exist as complexes with other PTS proteins or boundary metabolites, whereas in vitro, the fraction of complexed proteins is much smaller.",

Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority ( approximately 80%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode.",

A key role of creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes in this regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and in intracellular energy transport had been proposed, but has in the mean time been disputed for many years. It was hypothesized that high-energy phosphoryl groups are obligatorily transferred via CK; this is termed the phosphocreatine shuttle. The other important role ascribed to the CK system is its ability to buffer ADP concentration in cytosol near sites of ATP hydrolysis.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the experiments to determine the role of CK had been done in the steady state, but recently the dynamic response of oxidative phosphorylation to quick changes in cytosolic ATP hydrolysis has been assessed at various levels of inhibition of CK. Steady state models of CK function in energy transfer existed but were unable to explain the dynamic response with CK inhibited.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to explain the mode of functioning of the CK system in heart, and in particular the role of different CK isoenzymes in the dynamic response to workload steps. For this purpose we used a mathematical model of cardiac muscle cell energy metabolism containing the kinetics of the key processes of energy production, consumption and transfer pathways. The model underscores that CK plays indeed a dual role in the cardiac cells. The buffering role of CK system is due to the activity of myofibrillar CK (MMCK) while the energy transfer role depends on the activity of mitochondrial CK (MiCK). We propose that this may lead to the differences in regulation mechanisms and energy transfer modes in species with relatively low MiCK activity such as rabbit in comparison with species with high MiCK activity such as rat.\r\n\r\nThe model needed modification to explain the new type of experimental data on the dynamic response of the mitochondria. We submit that building a Virtual Muscle Cell is not possible without continuous experimental tests to improve the model. In close interaction with experiments we are developing a model for muscle energy metabolism and transport mediated by the creatine kinase isoforms which now already can explain many different types of experiments.",

In most cell types the mechanism of regular spiking is well understood and models based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) can account for many experimental observations. However, cells do not always exhibit simple Ca(2+) oscillations. In response to given agonists, some cells show more complex behaviour in the form of bursting, i.e. trains of Ca(2+) spikes separated by silent phases. Here we develop several theoretical models, based on physiologically plausible assumptions, that could account for complex intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations. The models are all based on one- or two-pool models based on CICR. We extend these models by (i) considering the inhibition of the Ca(2+)-release channel on a unique intracellular store at high cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, (ii) taking into account the Ca(2+)-activated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), or (iii) considering explicity the evolution of the Ca(2+) concentration in two different pools, one sensitive and the other one insensitive to IP(3). Besides simple periodic oscillations, these three models can all account for more complex oscillatory behaviour in the form of bursting. Moreover, the model that takes the kinetics of IP(3) into account shows chaotic behaviour.",

These intermediates inactivate many types of biomolecules, including peroxidase itself. Previously, we have shown that oscillatory dynamics in the peroxidase-oxidase reaction seem to protect the enzyme from inactivation. It was suggested that this is due to a lower average concentration of reactive oxygen species in the oscillatory state compared to the steady state. Here, we studied the peroxidase-oxidase reaction with either 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or melatonin as cofactors. We show that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is present in both cases. We also found that the enzyme degradation depends on the concentration of the cofactor and on the pH of the reaction mixture. We simulated the oscillatory behaviour, including the oscillation\/steady state bistability observed experimentally, using a detailed reaction scheme. The computational results confirm the hypothesis that protection is due to lower average concentrations of superoxide radical during oscillations. They also show that the shape of the oscillations changes with increasing cofactor concentration resulting in a further decrease in the average concentration of radicals. We therefore hypothesize that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is a general effect in this system.",

However, the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state) levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.",

The measured responses were DFG, 3-deoxyosone, 1-deoxyosone, methylglyoxal, acetic acid, formic acid, glucose, fructose, mannose and melanoidins. For each system the model parameters, the rate constants, were estimated by non-linear regression, via multiresponse modelling. The determinant criterion was used as the statistical fit criterion. Model discrimination was performed by both chemical insight and statistical tests (Posterior Probability and Akaike criterion). Kinetic analysis showed that at lower pH DFG 1,2-enolization is favoured whereas with increasing pH 2,3-enolization becomes a more relevant degradation pathway. The lower amount observed of 1-DG is related with its high reactivity. It was shown that acetic acid, a main degradation product from DFG, was mainly formed through 1-DG degradation. Also from the estimated parameters 3-DG was found to be the main precursor in carbohydrate fragments formation, responsible for colour formation. Some indication was given that as the reaction proceeded other compounds besides DFG become reactants themselves with the formation among others of methylglyoxal.

These have been linked to protein modifications found during aging, diabetes and various amyloidoses. To investigate the contribution of alternative routes to the formation of AGEs, we developed a mathematical model that describes the generation of CML [ N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine] in the Maillard reaction between glucose and collagen. Parameter values were obtained by fitting published data from kinetic experiments of Amadori compound decomposition and glycoxidation of collagen by glucose. These raw parameter values were subsequently fine-tuned with adjustment factors that were deduced from dynamic experiments taking into account the glucose and phosphate buffer concentrations. The fine-tuned model was used to assess the relative contributions of the reaction between glyoxal and lysine, the Namiki pathway, and Amadori compound degradation to the generation of CML. The model suggests that the glyoxal route dominates, except at low phosphate and high glucose concentrations. The contribution of Amadori oxidation is generally the least significant at low glucose concentrations. Simulations of the inhibition of CML generation by aminoguanidine show that this compound effectively blocks the glyoxal route at low glucose concentrations (5 mM). Model results are compared with literature estimates of the contributions to CML generation by the three pathways. The significance of the dominance of the glyoxal route is discussed in the context of possible natural defensive mechanisms and pharmacological interventions with the goal of inhibiting the Maillard reaction in vivo.",

This stabilization is provided via an increase in adenylate pool in association with ATPases rate elevation. Proper regulation of adenylate pool size might be achieved even in the case when AMP synthesis rate remains constant and only AMP degradation rate varies. The best stabilization of intracellular ion concentration in the model is attained when the rate of AMP destruction is directly proportional to ATP concentration and is inversely proportional to AMP concentration. An optimal rate of adenylate metabolism in erythrocytes ranges from several tenths of a percent to several percent of the glycolytic flux.

Using a previous model of intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells, this article explores the effects of coupling two cells with a simple linear diffusion term. Depending on the concentration of a signal molecule, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, coupling two identical cells by diffusion can give rise to synchronized in-phase oscillations, as well as different-amplitude in-phase oscillations and same-amplitude antiphase oscillations.

For parameters that reproduce experimental data for the RyR from cardiac cells, adaptation of the RyR in combination with sarco\/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase Ca2+ pumps in the internal stores can give rise to either low [Cai2+] steady states or Ca2+ oscillations coexisting with unphysiologically high [Cai2+] steady states. In this closed-cell-type model rapid, adaptation-dependent Ca2+ oscillations occur only in limited ranges of parameters. In the presence of Ca2+ influx and efflux from outside the cell (open-cell model) Ca2+ oscillations occur for a wide range of physiological parameter values and have a period that is determined by the rate of Ca2+ refilling of the stores. Although the rate of adaptation of the RyR has a role in determining the shape and the period of the Ca2+ spike, it is not essential for their existence. This is in marked contrast with what is observed for the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor for which the biphasic activation and inhibition of its activity by Ca2+ are sufficient to produce oscillations. Results for this model are compared with those based on Ca2+(-)induced Ca2+ release alone in the bullfrog sympathetic neuron. This kinetic model should be suitable for analyzing phenomena associated with \"Ca2+ sparks,\" including their merger into Ca2+ waves in cardiac myocytes.",

Intracellular concentrations of substrates and effectors for most key pathway enzymes were estimated from in vivo phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. These data show the validity in vivo of kinetic models previously proposed for phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase based on in vitro studies. Kinetic representations of hexokinase, glycogen synthetase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which incorporate major regulatory properties of these enzymes, are all consistent with the in vivo data. This detailed model of pathway kinetics and these data on intracellular metabolite concentrations allow evaluation of flux-control coefficients for all key enzymes involved in glucose catabolism under the four different cell environments examined. This analysis indicates that alginate entrapment increases the glucose uptake rate and shifts the step most influencing ethanol production from glucose uptake to phosphofructokinase.

The model successfully simulates the main features of the time courses of threonine synthesis previously observed in a cell-free extract without alteration of the experimentally determined parameters, although improved quantitative fits can be obtained with small parameter adjustments. At the concentrations of enzymes, precursors and products present in cells, the model predicts a threonine-synthesis flux close to that required to support cell growth. Furthermore, the first two enzymes operate close to equilibrium, providing an example of a near-equilibrium feedback-inhibited enzyme. The predicted flux control coefficients of the pathway enzymes under physiological conditions show that the control of flux is shared between the first three enzymes: aspartate kinase, aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase and homoserine dehydrogenase, with no single activity dominating the control. The response of the model to the external metabolites shows that the sharing of control between the three enzymes holds across a wide range of conditions, but that the pathway flux is sensitive to the aspartate concentration. When the model was embedded in a larger model to simulate the variable demands for threonine at different growth rates, it showed the accumulation of free threonine that is typical of the Tir-8 strain at low growth rates. At low growth rates, the control of threonine flux remains largely with the pathway enzymes.

To achieve transcriptional and metabolic integration characteristic of natural oscillators, here we designed and constructed a synthetic circuit in Escherichia coli K12, using glycolytic flux to generate oscillation through the signalling metabolite acetyl phosphate. If two metabolite pools are interconverted by two enzymes that are placed under the transcriptional control of acetyl phosphate, the system oscillates when the glycolytic rate exceeds a critical value.

Threonine synthase is activated by S-adenosylmethionine and inhibited by AMP. Cystathionine gamma-synthase condenses phosphohomoserine to cysteine via a ping-pong mechanism. Reactions are irreversible and inhibited by inorganic phosphate. The modelling procedure included an examination of the kinetic links, the determination of the operating conditions in chloroplasts and the establishment of a computer model using the enzyme rate equations. To test the model, the branch-point was reconstituted with purified enzymes. The computer model showed a partial agreement with the in vitro results. The model was subsequently improved and was then found consistent with flux partition in vitro and in vivo. Under near physiological conditions, S-adenosylmethionine, but not AMP, modulates the partition of a steady-state flux of phosphohomoserine. The computer model indicates a high sensitivity of cystathionine flux to enzyme and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations. Cystathionine flux is sensitive to modulation of threonine flux whereas the reverse is not true. The cystathionine gamma-synthase kinetic mechanism favours a low sensitivity of the fluxes to cysteine. Though sensitivity to inorganic phosphate is low, its concentration conditions the dynamics of the system. Threonine synthase and cystathionine gamma-synthase display similar kinetic efficiencies in the metabolic context considered and are first-order for the phosphohomoserine substrate.

RESULTS: We have constructed a semi-quantitative computational dynamic systems model of the activation of Src at mitosis based on protein interactions described in the literature. Through numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis we show that Src regulation involves a bistable switch, a pattern increasingly recognised as essential to biochemical signalling. The switch is operated by the tyrosine kinase CSK, which itself is involved in a negative feedback loop with Src. Negative feedback generates an excitable system, which produces transient activation of Src. One of the system parameters, which is linked to the cyclin dependent kinase cdc2, controls excitability via a second bistable switch. This topology allows for differentiated responses to a multitude of signals. The model offers explanations for the existence of the positive and negative feedback loops involving protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (PTPalpha) and translocation of CSK and predicts a specific relationship between Src phosphorylation and activity.",

Aerobic metabolism depends on the activities of glycosomal triosephosphate isomerase and a mitochondrial glycerophosphate oxidase, and on glycerophosphate<-->dihydroxyacetone phosphate exchange across the glycosomal membrane. Using a combination of genetics and computer modelling, we show that triosephosphate isomerase is probably essential for bloodstream trypanosome survival, but not for the insect-dwelling procyclics, which preferentially use amino acids as an energy source. When the enzyme level decreased to about 15% of that of the wild-type, the growth rate was halved. Below this level, a lethal rise in dihydroxyacetone phosphate was predicted. Expression of cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase inhibited cell growth.

Kinetic parameters were collected from published values. Maximal enzyme activities and intracellular effector concentrations were determined experimentally. The model was validated by comparing experimental results on the rate of glycerol production to the rate calculated by the model. Values calculated by the model agreed well with those measured in independent experiments. The model also mimics the changes in the rate of glycerol synthesis at different phases of growth. Metabolic control analysis values calculated by the model indicate that the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction has a flux control coefficient (C(J)v1) of approximately 0.85 and exercises the majority of the control of flux through the pathway. Response coefficients of parameter metabolites indicate that flux through the pathway is most responsive to dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration (R(J)DHAP= 0.48 to 0.69), followed by ATP concentration (R(J)ATP = -0.21 to -0.50). Interestingly, the pathway responds weakly to NADH concentration (R(J)NADH = 0.03 to 0.08).

In agreement with experimental observations, the model can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness, characterized by an antiphase relationship between Per\/Cry\/Rev-Erbalpha and Bmal1 mRNAs. Sustained oscillations correspond to the rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei. For other parameter values, damped oscillations can also be obtained in the model. These oscillations, which transform into sustained oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.",

        "abstract":"The resolution to lose weight by cognitive restraint of nutritional intake often leads to repeated bouts of weight loss and regain, a phenomenon known as weight cycling or \"yo-yo dieting\". A simple mathematical model for weight cycling is presented. The model is based on a feedback of psychological nature by which a subject decides to reduce dietary intake once a threshold weight is exceeded. The analysis of the model indicates that sustained oscillations in body weight occur in a parameter range bounded by critical values. Only outside this range can body weight reach a stable steady state. The model provides a theoretical framework that captures key facets of weight cycling and suggests ways to control the phenomenon. The view that weight cycling represents self-sustained oscillations has indeed specific implications. In dynamical terms, to bring weight cycling to an end, parameter values should change in such a way as to induce the transition of body weight from sustained oscillations around an unstable steady state to a stable steady state. Maintaining weight under a critical value should prevent weight cycling and allow body weight to stabilize below the oscillatory range.",

        "abstract":"Activation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase in the presence of GTP, the natural guanine nucleotide regulator, are too fast to study by standard biochemical methods. In order to identify the rate-limiting steps in adenylate cyclase regulation, we measured the kinetics of stimulation and inhibition of the enzyme on a subsecond to second time scale using a novel rapid-mix quench technique. Even using our rapid-mix quench method, activation by PGE1 and forskolin was instantaneous (cAMP accumulation was linear between 0.5 and 30 s). In contrast, we found a lag period of 1.2-10 s for epinephrine-mediated inhibition. The length of the lag depended on the concentration of GTP and monovalent cations present. In the absence of NaCl, the rate constant for the onset of inhibition (kinh) increased only slightly with GTP concentration saturating at a value of 0.16 s-1 (t1\/2 4.3 s) at 1 microM GTP. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, kinh was strongly dependent on GTP concentration, reaching a maximum value of 0.57 s-1 (t1\/2 1.2 s) at 100 microM GTP. Thus, activation of both Gi and Gs in intact platelet membranes is much faster (t1\/2 less than 5 s) than previously reported for reconstituted systems. Also, the strong dependence of the rate of adenylate cyclase inhibition on GTP concentration implies that the rate-limiting step in inhibition is distal to GTP binding. The effect of NaCl to increase the maximal rate of inhibition is specific for sodium since KCl has no effect on kinh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract":"Receptor-mediated modulation of KCNQ channels regulates neuronal excitability. This study concerns the kinetics and mechanism of M1 muscarinic receptor-mediated regulation of the cloned neuronal M channel, KCNQ2\/KCNQ3 (Kv7.2\/Kv7.3). Receptors, channels, various mutated G-protein subunits, and an optical probe for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were coexpressed by transfection in tsA-201 cells, and the cells were studied by whole-cell patch clamp and by confocal microscopy. Constitutively active forms of Galphaq and Galpha11, but not Galpha13, caused a loss of the plasma membrane PIP2 and a total tonic inhibition of the KCNQ current. There were no further changes upon addition of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M (oxo-M). Expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling, RGS2, blocked PIP2 hydrolysis and current suppression by muscarinic stimulation, confirming that the Gq family of G-proteins is necessary. Dialysis with the competitive inhibitor GDPbetaS (1 mM) lengthened the time constant of inhibition sixfold, decreased the suppression of current, and decreased agonist sensitivity. Removal of intracellular Mg2+ slowed both the development and the recovery from muscarinic suppression. When combined with GDPbetaS, low intracellular Mg2+ nearly eliminated muscarinic inhibition. With nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, current suppression developed spontaneously and muscarinic inhibition was enhanced. Such spontaneous suppression was antagonized by GDPbetaS or GTP or by expression of RGS2. These observations were successfully described by a kinetic model representing biochemical steps of the signaling cascade using published rate constants where available. The model supports the following sequence of events for this Gq-coupled signaling: A classical G-protein cycle, including competition for nucleotide-free G-protein by all nucleotide forms and an activation step requiring Mg2+, followed by G-protein-stimulated phospholipase C and hydrolysis of PIP2, and finally PIP2 dissociation from binding sites for inositol lipid on the channels so that KCNQ current was suppressed. Further experiments will be needed to refine some untested assumptions.",

        "abstract":"The functional significance of high affinity agonist binding to receptors that interact with guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins has remained controversial. Preincubation of human platelet membranes with the full alpha 2-agonist UK 14,304 in the absence of GTP increases the potency of the agonist to inhibit adenylate cyclase in a pre-steady state (15-sec) assay. The EC50 after preincubation (6 +\/- 1 nM) is within a factor of 2 of the high affinity Kd for [3H]UK 14,304 binding determined under identical conditions (2.7 +\/- 0.1 nM). In contrast, in the usual steady state measurements (15 min) or in pre-steady state measurements without agonist preincubation, the EC50 values (74 +\/- 1 and 207 +\/- 8 nM, respectively) are near the low affinity Kd for [3H]UK 14,304 binding. Reduction of the GTP concentration in steady state adenylate cyclase assays also decreases the EC50 for UK 14,304 from 40 +\/- 5 nM at 10 microM GTP to 14 +\/- 5 nM with no added GTP. Both sets of experimental observations are accommodated by a complete kinetic model of inhibition in which the high affinity ternary complex of drug, receptor, and G protein leads to the response. Explicit rate parameters are included for agonist binding, receptor-G protein interactions, GTP binding, and hydrolysis. Despite the functional role of the high affinity state of the alpha 2-receptor in this model, the steady state EC50 for agonist-mediated inhibition correlates best with the Kd of low affinity agonist binding in the presence of high levels of GTP. Under conditions in which formation of the high affinity ternary complex is favored, the EC50 for responses approaches the high affinity Kd.",

We then identify and prove new principles, such that total control on signal amplitude and on final signal strength must amount to zero, and total control on signal duration and on integral signal intensity must equal -1. Collectively, kinases control amplitudes more than duration, whereas phosphatases tend to control both. We illustrate and validate these principles experimentally: (a) a kinase inhibitor affects the amplitude of EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation much more than its duration and (b) a phosphatase inhibitor influences both signal duration and signal amplitude, in particular long after EGF administration.

The DNA damage response requires the coordinated interaction between DNA repair and checkpoint pathways. Telomeres of budding yeast are capped by the Cdc13 complex. In the temperature-sensitive cdc13-1 strain, telomeres are unprotected over a specific temperature range leading to activation of the DNA damage response and subsequently cell-cycle arrest. Inactivation of cdc13-1 results in the generation of long regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is affected by the activity of various checkpoint proteins and nucleases. This paper describes a mathematical model of how uncapped telomeres in budding yeast initiate the checkpoint pathway leading to cell-cycle arrest. The model was encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and simulated using the stochastic simulation system Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation (BASIS). Each simulation follows the time course of one mother cell keeping track of the number of cell divisions, the level of activity of each of the checkpoint proteins, the activity of nucleases and the amount of ssDNA generated. The model can be used to carry out a variety of in silico experiments in which different genes are knocked out and the results of simulation are compared to experimental data. Possible extensions to the model are also discussed.",

        "abstract":"Many molecular chaperones are also known as heat shock proteins because they are synthesised in increased amounts after brief exposure of cells to elevated temperatures. They have many cellular functions and are involved in the folding of nascent proteins, the re-folding of denatured proteins, the prevention of protein aggregation, and assisting the targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome and lysosomes. They also have a role in apoptosis and are involved in modulating signals for immune and inflammatory responses. Stress-induced transcription of heat shock proteins requires the activation of heat shock factor (HSF). Under normal conditions, HSF is bound to heat shock proteins resulting in feedback repression. During stress, cellular proteins undergo denaturation and sequester heat shock proteins bound to HSF, which is then able to become transcriptionally active. The induction of heat shock proteins is impaired with age and there is also a decline in chaperone function. Aberrant\/damaged proteins accumulate with age and are implicated in several important age-related conditions (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cataract). Therefore, the balance between damaged proteins and available free chaperones may be greatly disturbed during ageing. We have developed a mathematical model to describe the heat shock system. The aim of the model is two-fold: to explore the heat shock system and its implications in ageing; and to demonstrate how to build a model of a biological system using our simulation system (biology of ageing e-science integration and simulation (BASIS)).",

Our approach accelerates the iterative process of model identification, to incorporate new components, and to systematically test different proposed structural hypotheses.

        "abstract":"In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. & Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. & Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.",

        "abstract":"A network of interacting proteins has been found that can account for the spontaneous oscillations in adenylyl cyclase activity that are observed in homogenous populations of Dictyostelium cells 4 h after the initiation of development. Previous biochemical assays have shown that when extracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) binds to the surface receptor CAR1, adenylyl cyclase and the MAP kinase ERK2 are transiently activated. A rise in the internal concentration of cAMP activates protein kinase A such that it inhibits ERK2 and leads to a loss-of-ligand binding by CAR1. ERK2 phosphorylates the cAMP phosphodiesterase REG A that reduces the internal concentration of cAMP. A secreted phosphodiesterase reduces external cAMP concentrations between pulses. Numerical solutions to a series of nonlinear differential equations describing these activities faithfully account for the observed periodic changes in cAMP. The activity of each of the components is necessary for the network to generate oscillatory behavior; however, the model is robust in that 25-fold changes in the kinetic constants linking the activities have only minor effects on the predicted frequency. Moreover, constant high levels of external cAMP lead to attenuation, whereas a brief pulse of cAMP can advance or delay the phase such that interacting cells become entrained.",

For the case of simple Ca(2+) oscillations, the roles of cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations in the regulation of active phosphorylase depend upon the maximum rate of IP(3) degradation by the 3-kinase, V(M5). In particular, the smaller the values of V(M5) are, the lower the effective Ca(2+) threshold for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase will be. For the case of complex Ca(2+) oscillations, the average level of fraction of active phosphorylase is nearly independent from the level of stimulation increasing in the bursting oscillatory domain. Both simple and complex Ca(2+) oscillations can contribute to increase the efficiency and specificity of cellular signalling, and some theoretical results of activation of glycogen phosphorylase regulated by Ca(2+) oscillations are close to the experimental results for gene expression in lymphocytes.",

        "abstract":"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for homeostatic degradation of intact protein substrates as well as the elimination of damaged or misfolded proteins that might otherwise aggregate. During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML). Simulations are carried out on the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation) system and the model output is compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under various conditions. The model can be used to predict the effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation.The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different conditions. However, our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under conditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics.We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. Using SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process.",

How to design drugs and evaluate their functions at the systems level becomes a key issue in highly efficient and low-side-effect drug design. The arachidonic acid metabolic network is the network that produces inflammatory mediators, in which several enzymes, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), have been used as targets for anti-inflammatory drugs. However, neither the century-old nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs nor the recently revocatory Vioxx have provided completely successful anti-inflammatory treatment. To gain more insights into the anti-inflammatory drug design, the authors have studied the dynamic properties of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic network in human polymorphous leukocytes. Metabolic flux, exogenous AA effects, and drug efficacy have been analyzed using ordinary differential equations. The flux balance in the AA network was found to be important for efficient and safe drug design. When only the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor was used, the flux of the COX-2 pathway was increased significantly, showing that a single functional inhibitor cannot effectively control the production of inflammatory mediators. When both COX-2 and 5-LOX were blocked, the production of inflammatory mediators could be completely shut off. The authors have also investigated the differences between a dual-functional COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitor and a mixture of these two types of inhibitors. Their work provides an example for the integration of systems biology and drug discovery.",

To uncover the full dynamical possibilities of the control system, we translate the regulatory network into a set of differential equations and study these equations by graphical techniques and computer simulation. The positive feedback loops in the model account for thresholds and time lags in cyclin-induced and MPF-induced activation of MPF, and the model can be fitted quantitatively to these experimental observations. The negative feedback loop is consistent with observed time lags in MPF-induced cyclin degradation. Furthermore, our model indicates that there are two possible mechanisms for autonomous oscillations. One is driven by the positive feedback loops, resulting in phosphorylation and abrupt dephosphorylation of the Cdc2 subunit at an inhibitory tyrosine residue. These oscillations are typical of oocyte extracts. The other type is driven by the negative feedback loop, involving rapid cyclin turnover and negligible phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of Cdc2. The early mitotic cycles of intact embryos exhibit such characteristics. In addition, by assuming that unreplicated DNA interferes with M-phase initiation by activating the phosphatases that oppose MPF in the positive feedback loops, we can simulate the effect of addition of sperm nuclei to oocyte extracts, and the lengthening of cycle times at the mid-blastula transition of intact embryos.",

The enzyme plays an important role in diseases like trisomy 21 and also in theories of the mechanisms of aging. But instead of being beneficial, intensified oxidative stress is associated with the increased expression of SOD and also studies on bacteria and transgenic animals show that high levels of SOD actually lead to increased lipid peroxidation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Using mathematical models we investigate the question how overexpression of SOD can lead to increased oxidative stress, although it is an antioxidant enzyme. We consider the following possibilities that have been proposed in the literature: (i) Reaction of H(2)O(2) with CuZnSOD leading to hydroxyl radical formation. (ii) Superoxide radicals might reduce membrane damage by acting as radical chain breaker. (iii) While detoxifying superoxide radicals SOD cycles between a reduced and oxidized state. At low superoxide levels the intermediates might interact with other redox partners and increase the superoxide reductase (SOR) activity of SOD. This short-circuiting of the SOD cycle could lead to an increased hydrogen peroxide production. We find that only one of the proposed mechanisms is under certain circumstances able to explain the increased oxidative stress caused by SOD. But furthermore we identified an additional mechanism that is of more general nature and might be a common basis for the experimental findings. We call it the alternative pathway mechanism.",

We found in mink lung epithelial cells that Smad2 (8.5-12 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)) was present in similar amounts to Smad4 (9.3-12 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)), whereas both were in excess of Smad3 (1.1-2.0 x 10(4) molecules cell(-1)). Variation of the model parameters and statistical analysis showed that Smad nuclear accumulation is most sensitive to parameters affecting the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and Smad complex formation\/ dissociation in the nucleus. Deleting Smad4 from the model revealed that rate-limiting phospho-R-Smad dephosphorylation could be an important mechanism for Smad nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we observed that binding factors constitutively localised to the nucleus do not efficiently mediate Smad nuclear accumulation, if dephosphorylation is rapid. We therefore conclude that an imbalance in the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is likely an important mechanism of Smad nuclear accumulation during TGFbeta signalling.",

        "abstract":"Given the ubiquitous nature of signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations, the question arises as to how cellular responses are affected by repetitive Ca2+ spikes. Among these responses, we focus on those involving protein phosphorylation. We examine, by numerical simulations of a theoretical model, the situation where a protein is phosphorylated by a Ca(2+)-activated kinase and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase. This reversible phosphorylation system is coupled to a mechanism generating cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations; for definiteness, this oscillatory mechanism is based on the process of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. The analysis shows that the average fraction of phosphorylated protein increases with the frequency of repetitive Ca2+ spikes; the latter frequency generally rises with the extent of external stimulation. Protein phosphorylation therefore provides a mechanism for the encoding of the external stimulation in terms of the frequency of signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Such a frequency encoding requires precise kinetic conditions on the Michaelis-Menten constants of the kinase and phosphatase, their maximal rates, and the degree of cooperativity in kinase activation by Ca2+. In particular, the most efficient encoding of Ca2+ oscillations based on protein phosphorylation occurs in conditions of zero-order ultrasensitivity, when the kinase and phosphatase are saturated by their protein substrate. The kinetic analysis uncovers a wide variety of temporal patterns of phosphorylation that could be driven by signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations.",

We show, through modeling, that the physiological response of such pathways exposed to simultaneous and temporally ordered inputs can demonstrate system-level mechanisms by which pathways achieve specificity. We apply these results to the hyperosmolar and pheromone mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These two pathways specifically sense osmolar and pheromone signals, despite sharing a MAPKKK, Ste11, and having homologous MAPKs (Fus3 and Hog1). We show that in a single cell, the pathways are bistable over a range of inputs, and the cell responds to only one stimulus even when exposed to both.

Burstiness is low in neurons exposed to a normal extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](o)), but is markedly enhanced by lowering [Ca(2+)](o), although not by blocking Ca(2+) and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents. We show, using intracellular recordings, that burstiness in low [Ca(2+)](o) persists even after truncating the apical dendrites, suggesting that bursts are generated by an interplay of membrane currents at or near the soma. To study the mechanisms of bursting, we have constructed a conductance-based, one-compartment model of CA1 pyramidal neurons. In this neuron model, reduced [Ca(2+)](o) is simulated by negatively shifting the activation curve of the persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)) as indicated by recent experimental results. The neuron model accounts, with different parameter sets, for the diversity of firing patterns observed experimentally in both zero and normal [Ca(2+)](o). Increasing I(NaP) in the neuron model induces bursting and increases the number of spikes within a burst but is neither necessary nor sufficient for bursting. We show, using fast-slow analysis and bifurcation theory, that the M-type K(+) current (I(M)) allows bursting by shifting neuronal behavior between a silent and a tonically active state provided the kinetics of the spike generating currents are sufficiently, although not extremely, fast. We suggest that bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells can be explained by a single compartment \"square bursting\" mechanism with one slow variable, the activation of I(M).",

The model also explains the recent counter-intuitive observation that endogenous 'null' ligands can significantly enhance T-cell signalling.

Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidine-specific alkylating reagent, is known to modify the histidine residues of the structure of proteins. The objective of this study was to determine whether DEPC modifies K(ATP)-channel activity in pituitary GH(3) cells. Steady-state fluctuation analyses of macroscopic K(+) current at -120 mV produced power spectra that could be fitted with a single Lorentzian curve in these cells. The time constants in the presence of DEPC were increased. Consistent with fluctuation analyses, the mean open time of K(ATP)-channels was significantly increased during exposure to DEPC. However, DEPC produced no change in single-channel conductance, despite the ability of this compound to enhance K(ATP)-channel activity in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 16 microM. DEPC-stimulated K(ATP)-channel activity was attenuated by pretreatment with glibenclamide. In current-clamp configuration, DEPC decreased the firing of action potentials in GH(3) cells. A further application of glibenclamide reversed DEPC-induced inhibition of spontaneous action potentials. Intracellullar Ca(2+) measurements revealed the ability of DEPC to decrease Ca(2+) oscillations in GH(3) cells. Simulation studies also demonstrated that the increased conductance of K(ATP)-channels used to mimic DEPC actions reduced the frequency of spontaneous action potentials and fluctuation of intracellular Ca(2+). The results indicate that chemical modification with DEPC enhances K(ATP)-channel activity and influences functional activities of pituitary GH(3) cells.",

Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function.Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate.

We considered the fast K+ currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both IBK and IA could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms.

The model predicts that after activation of a neutrophil, an increase in the activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt and the delivery of myeloperoxidase into the phagosome results in oscillations in oxygen and NAD(P)H concentration. The period of oscillation changes from >200 s to 10-30 s. The model is consistent with previously reported oscillations in cell metabolism and oxidant production. Key features and predictions of the model were confirmed experimentally. The requirement of the hexose monophosphate pathway for 10 s oscillations was verified using 6-aminonicotinamide and dexamethasone, which are inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The role of the NADPH oxidase in promoting oscillations was confirmed by dose-response studies of the effect of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase. Moreover, the model predicted an increase in the amplitude of NADPH oscillations in the presence of melatonin, which was confirmed experimentally.

        "abstract":"Immediately following fertilization, the fruit fly embryo undergoes 13 rapid, synchronous, syncytial nuclear division cycles driven by maternal genes and proteins. During these mitotic cycles, there are barely detectable oscillations in the total level of B-type cyclins. In this paper, we propose a dynamical model for the molecular events underlying these early nuclear division cycles in Drosophila. The model distinguishes nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the embryo and permits exploration of a variety of rules for protein transport between the compartments. Numerical simulations reproduce the main features of wild-type mitotic cycles: patterns of protein accumulation and degradation, lengthening of later cycles, and arrest in interphase 14. The model is consistent with mutations that introduce subtle changes in the number of mitotic cycles before interphase arrest. Bifurcation analysis of the differential equations reveals the dependence of mitotic oscillations on cycle number, and how this dependence is altered by mutations. The model can be used to predict the phenotypes of novel mutations and effective ranges of the unmeasured rate constants and transport coefficients in the proposed mechanism.",

The quantitative effect of ATP concentration upon the oscillations was successfully simulated. Our simulation results support previous experimental explanations that the Ca(2+) oscillations are mainly due to interaction of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pump back into the ER, and the oscillations are prolonged by extracellular Ca(2+) entry that maintains the constant Ca(2+) supplies to its intracellular stores. The model is also able to simulate the sudden disappearance phenomenon of the Ca(2+) oscillations observed in some cell types by taking into account of the biphasic characteristic of the Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, the model simulation results for the Ca(2+) oscillations characteristics such as duration, peak [Ca(2+)](cyt), and average interval, etc., lead to prediction of some possible factors responsible for the variations of Ca(2+) oscillations in different types of cells.",

In the present study, we examined heregulin (HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259). As the time-course kinetics of Akt and ERK activities seemed to be transient and complex, we constructed a mathematical simulation model for HRG-induced ErbB4 receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism in this signal transduction cascade. The model reflected well the experimental results observed in HRG-induced ErbB4 cells and in other modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt cross-talk. The model suggested that HRG signalling is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.",

However, disease-associated aberrant activity of the pathway is often due to misregulation of the equilibrium state. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is typically described as being held inactive in the cytoplasm by binding its inhibitor, IkappaB, until an external stimulus triggers IkappaB degradation through an IkappaB kinase-dependent degradation pathway. Combining genetic, biochemical, and computational tools, we investigate steady-state regulation of the NF-kappaB signaling module and its impact on stimulus responsiveness. We present newly measured in vivo degradation rate constants for NF-kappaB-bound and -unbound IkappaB proteins that are critical for accurate computational predictions of steady-state IkappaB protein levels and basal NF-kappaB activity. Simulations reveal a homeostatic NF-kappaB signaling module in which differential degradation rates of free and bound pools of IkappaB represent a novel cross-regulation mechanism that imparts functional robustness to the signaling module.",

        "abstract":"The Wnt and the extracellular signal regulated-kinase (ERK) pathways are both involved in the pathogenesis of various kinds of cancers. Recently, the existence of crosstalk between Wnt and ERK pathways was reported. Gathering all reported results, we have discovered a positive feedback loop embedded in the crosstalk between the Wnt and ERK pathways. We have developed a plausible model that represents the role of this hidden positive feedback loop in the Wnt\/ERK pathway crosstalk based on the integration of experimental reports and employing established basic mathematical models of each pathway. Our analysis shows that the positive feedback loop can generate bistability in both the Wnt and ERK signaling pathways, and this prediction was further validated by experiments. In particular, using the commonly accepted assumption that mutations in signaling proteins contribute to cancerogenesis, we have found two conditions through which mutations could evoke an irreversible response leading to a sustained activation of both pathways. One condition is enhanced production of beta-catenin, the other is a reduction of the velocity of MAP kinase phosphatase(s). This enables that high activities of Wnt and ERK pathways are maintained even without a persistent extracellular signal. Thus, our study adds a novel aspect to the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis by showing that mutational changes in individual proteins can cause fundamental functional changes well beyond the pathway they function in by a positive feedback loop embedded in crosstalk. Thus, crosstalk between signaling pathways provides a vehicle through which mutations of individual components can affect properties of the system at a larger scale.",

Despite our understanding of the structural changes, which occur upon Cdk\/cyclin formation and activation, little is known about the dynamics of the molecular events involved. We have characterized the mechanism of Cdk2\/cyclin A complex formation and activation at the molecular and dynamic level by rapid kinetics and demonstrate here that it is a two-step process. The first step involves the rapid association between the PSTAIRE helix of Cdk2 and helices 3 and 5 of the cyclin to yield an intermediate complex in which the threonine in the T-loop is not accessible for phosphorylation. Additional contacts between the C-lobe of the Cdk and the N-terminal helix of the cyclin then induce the isomerization of the Cdk into a fully mature form by promoting the exposure of the T-loop for phosphorylation by CAK and the formation of the substrate binding site. This conformational change is selective for the cyclin partner.",

        "abstract":"Cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) play an important role in triggering the acute phase response of the body to injury or inflammation. Signaling by IL-6 involves two pathways: Janus-associated kinases (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT 3) are activated in the first pathway while the second pathway involves the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). While it is recognized that both pathways play a major role in IL-6 signal transduction, a majority of studies have focused on signaling through either one of the pathways. However, simultaneous signaling through both JAK\/STAT and MAPK pathways is still poorly understood. In this work, a mathematical model has been developed that integrates signaling through both the JAK\/STAT and the MAPK pathway. The presented model is used to analyze the effect of three molecules that are involved in the regulation of IL-6 signaling-SHP-2 (domain containing tyrosine phosphatase 2), SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), and a STAT3 nuclear phosphatase (PP2)-on the dynamics of IL-6 signal transduction in hepatocytes. The obtained results suggest that interactions between SHP-2 and SOCS3 influence signaling through the JAK\/STAT and the MAPK pathways. It is shown that SHP-2 and SOCS3 do not just regulate the pathway that they are known to be associated with, (SHP-2 with MAPK and SOCS3 with JAK\/STAT), but also have a strong effect on the other pathway. Several simulations with SOCS3, SHP-2, and PP2 knockout cells, that is, where the signaling pathway is unable to produce these proteins, have been performed to characterize the effect of these regulatory proteins on IL-6 signal transduction in hepatocytes.",

When phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), DARPP-32 inhibits protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), whereas when phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) it inhibits PKA. DARPP-32 is also regulated by casein kinases and by several protein phosphatases. These complex and intricate regulations make simple predictions of DARPP-32 dynamic behaviour virtually impossible. We used detailed quantitative modelling of the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation to improve our understanding of its function. The models included all the combinations of the three best-characterized phosphorylation sites of DARPP-32, their regulation by kinases and phosphatases, and the regulation of those enzymes by cAMP and Ca(2+) signals. Dynamic simulations allowed us to observe the temporal relationships between cAMP and Ca(2+) signals. We confirmed that the proposed regulation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) by calcium can account for the observed decrease of Threonine 75 phosphorylation upon glutamate receptor activation. DARPP-32 is not simply a switch between PP1-inhibiting and PKA-inhibiting states. Sensitivity analysis showed that CDK5 activity is a major regulator of the response, as previously suggested. Conversely, the strength of the regulation of PP2A by PKA or by calcium had little effect on the PP1-inhibiting function of DARPP-32 in these conditions. The simulations showed that DARPP-32 is not only a robust signal integrator, but that its response also depends on the delay between cAMP and calcium signals affecting the response to the latter. This integration did not depend on the concentration of DARPP-32, while the absolute effect on PP1 varied linearly. In silico mutants showed that Ser137 phosphorylation affects the influence of the delay between dopamine and glutamate, and that constitutive phosphorylation in Ser137 transforms DARPP-32 in a quasi-irreversible switch.

In this study, we aim at using systems biology approach to provide dynamic analysis on this pathway. METHODOLOGY\/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We proposed a constraint-based modeling method to build a comprehensive mathematical model for the Smad dependent TGF-beta signaling pathway by fitting the experimental data and incorporating the qualitative constraints from the experimental analysis. The performance of the model generated by constraint-based modeling method is significantly improved compared to the model obtained by only fitting the quantitative data. The model agrees well with the experimental analysis of TGF-beta pathway, such as the time course of nuclear phosphorylated Smad, the subcellular location of Smad and signal response of Smad phosphorylation to different doses of TGF-beta. CONCLUSIONS\/SIGNIFICANCE: The simulation results indicate that the signal response to TGF-beta is regulated by the balance between clathrin dependent endocytosis and non-clathrin mediated endocytosis. This model is useful to be built upon as new precise experimental data are emerging. The constraint-based modeling method can also be applied to quantitative modeling of other signaling pathways.",

We performed live-cell imaging and systems modeling of PKA-mediated phosphorylation in neonatal cardiac myocytes in response to G-protein coupled receptor stimuli and UV photolysis of \"caged\" cAMP. cAMP accumulation was rate-limiting in PKA-mediated phosphorylation downstream of the beta-adrenergic receptor. Prostaglandin E1 stimulated higher PKA activity in the cytosol than at the sarcolemma, whereas isoproterenol triggered faster sarcolemmal responses than cytosolic, likely due to restricted cAMP diffusion from submembrane compartments.

The average activation of TF-A increases with the increase of the average amplitude of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, but decreases with the increase of the period of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, which are qualitatively consistent with the experimental results on the gene expression in lymphocytes. In stochastic case, it is found that a large internal fluctuation of the biochemical reaction can enhance gene expression efficiency specifically at a low level of external stimulations or at a small rate of TF-A dimer phosphorylation activated by Ca2+, which reduces the threshold of the average intracellular Ca2+ concentration for gene expression.",

In order to probe and gain insights into the signalling properties of the STAT module by computational means, we developed a simple non-linear ordinary differential equations model within the 'Virtual Cell' framework. Our results demonstrate that the STAT module can operate as a 'biphasic amplitude filter' with an ability to amplify input signals within a specific intermediate range.

Within single neurons, interlocked transcriptional\/translational feedback loops generate circadian rhythms on the molecular level. We present a mathematical model that reflects the essential features of the mammalian circadian oscillator to characterize the differential roles of negative and positive feedback loops. The oscillations that are obtained have a 24-h period and are robust toward parameter variations even when the positive feedback is replaced by a constantly expressed activator. This demonstrates the crucial role of the negative feedback for rhythm generation. Moreover, it explains the rhythmic phenotype of Rev-erbalpha-\/- mutant mice, where a positive feedback is missing. The interplay of negative and positive feedback reveals a complex dynamics. In particular, the model explains the unexpected rescue of circadian oscillations in Per2Brdm1\/Cry2-\/- double-mutant mice (Per2Brdm1 single-mutant mice are arrhythmic). Here, a decrease of positive feedback strength associated with mutating the Per2 gene is compensated by the Cry2-\/- mutation that simultaneously decreases the negative feedback strength. Finally, this model leads us to a testable prediction of a molecular and behavioral phenotype: circadian oscillations should be rescued when arrhythmic Per2Brdm1 mutant mice are crossed with Rev- erbalpha -\/- mutant mice.",

We modelled this process as a cascade of functional modules of interacting Rab GTPases. We demonstrate that intermodule interactions share similarities with the toggle switch described for the cell cycle. However, Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion is rather based on a newly characterized 'cut-out switch' analogous to an electrical safety-breaker. Both designs require cooperativity of auto-activation loops when coupled to a large pool of cytoplasmic proteins. Live cell imaging and endosome tracking provide experimental support to the cut-out switch in cargo progression and conversion of endosome identity along the degradative pathway.

        "abstract":"Experimental studies have demonstrated that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT\/A) causes flaccid paralysis by a multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, BoNT\/A is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently its zinc-dependent catalytic domain translocates into the neuroplasm where it cleaves a vesicle-docking protein, SNAP-25, to block neurally evoked cholinergic neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data concerning the onset of paralysis of skeletal muscles induced by BoNT\/A at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories were simulated with two different models that were represented by sets of coupled, first-order differential equations. In this study, the 3-step sequential model developed by Simpson (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 212:16-21,1980) was used to estimate upper limits of the times during which anti-toxins and other impermeable inhibitors of BoNT\/A can exert an effect. The experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants for BoNT\/A binding to and dissociating from its receptors. Because this 3-step model was not designed to reproduce temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin concentrations, a new BoNT\/A species and rate (k(S)) were added at the beginning of the reaction sequence to create a 4-step scheme. This unbound initial species is transformed at a rate determined by k(S) to a free species that is capable of binding. By systematically adjusting the values of k(S), the 4-step model simulated the rapid decline in NMJ function (k(S) >or= 0.01), the less rapid onset of paralysis in mice following i.m. injections (k (S) = 0.001), and the slow onset of the therapeutic effects of BoNT\/A (k(S) < 0.001) in man. This minimal modeling approach was not only verified by simulating experimental results, it helped to quantitatively define the time available for an inhibitor to have some effect (t(inhib)) and the relation between this time and the rate of paralysis onset. The 4-step model predicted that as the rate of paralysis becomes slower, the estimated upper limits of (t(inhib)) for impermeable inhibitors become longer. More generally, this modeling approach may be useful in studying the kinetics of other toxins or viruses that invade host cells by similar mechanisms, e.g., receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

Our study suggests that interlinked MIPF systems might be an evolutionary consequence acquired for a more reliable memory effect by enhancing robustness against noisy cellular environments.",

        "abstract":"A novel topology of regulatory networks abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle is studied by constructing a simple nonlinear model. A ternary positive feedback loop with only positive regulations is constructed with elements that activates the subsequent element in a clockwise fashion. A ternary negative feedback loop with only negative regulations is constructed with the elements that inhibit the subsequent element in an anticlockwise fashion. Positive feedback loop exhibits bistability, whereas the negative feedback loop exhibits limit cycle oscillations. The novelty of the topology is that the corresponding elements in these two homogeneous feedback loops are linked by the binary positive feedback loops with only positive regulations. This results in the emergence of mixed feedback loops in the network that displays complex behaviour like the coexistence of multiple steady states, relaxation oscillations and chaos. Importantly, the arrangement of the feedback loops brings in the notion of checkpoint in the model. The model also exhibits domino-like behaviour, where the limit cycle oscillations take place in a stepwise fashion. As the aforementioned topology is abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle, the events that govern the cell cycle are considered for the present study. In budding yeast, the sequential activation of the transcription factors, cyclins and their inhibitors form mixed feedback loops. The transcription factors that involve in the positive regulation in a clockwise orientation generates ternary positive feedback loop, while the cyclins and their inhibitors that involve in the negative regulation in an anticlockwise orientation generates ternary negative feedback loop. The mutual regulation between the corresponding elements in the transcription factors and the cyclins and their inhibitors generates binary positive feedback loops. The bifurcation diagram constructed for the whole system can be related to the different events of the cell cycle in terms of dynamical system theory. The checkpoint mechanism that plays an important role in different phases of the cell cycle are accounted for by silencing appropriate feedback loops in the model.",

The numerical simulations indicated that cell shape controls the dynamics of local biochemical activity of signal-modulated negative regulators, such as phosphodiesterases and protein phosphatases within regulatory loops to determine the size of microdomains of activated signaling components. The model prediction that negative regulators control the flow of spatial information to downstream components was verified experimentally in rat hippocampal slices.

We propose here a mathematical model of how spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations arise in astrocytes. This model uses the calcium-induced calcium release and inositol cross-coupling mechanisms coupled with a receptor-independent method for producing inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate as the heart of the model.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Virtually all living organisms have evolved a circadian (~24 hour) clock that controls physiological and behavioural processes with exquisite precision throughout the day\/night cycle. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which generates these ~24 h rhythms in mammals, consists of several thousand neurons. Each neuron contains a gene-regulatory network generating molecular oscillations, and the individual neuron oscillations are synchronised by intercellular coupling, presumably via neurotransmitters. Although this basic mechanism is currently accepted and has been recapitulated in mathematical models, several fundamental questions about the design principles of the SCN remain little understood. For example, a remarkable property of the SCN is that the phase of the SCN rhythm resets rapidly after a 'jet lag' type experiment, i.e. when the light\/dark (LD) cycle is abruptly advanced or delayed by several hours. RESULTS: Here, we describe an extensive parameter optimization of a previously constructed simplified model of the SCN in order to further understand its design principles. By examining the top 50 solutions from the parameter optimization, we show that the neurotransmitters' role in generating the molecular circadian rhythms is extremely important. In addition, we show that when a neurotransmitter drives the rhythm of a system of coupled damped oscillators, it exhibits very robust synchronization and is much more easily entrained to light\/dark cycles. We were also able to recreate in our simulations the fast rhythm resetting seen after a 'jet lag' type experiment. CONCLUSION: Our work shows that a careful exploration of parameter space for even an extremely simplified model of the mammalian clock can reveal unexpected behaviours and non-trivial predictions. Our results suggest that the neurotransmitter feedback loop plays a crucial role in the robustness and phase resetting properties of the mammalian clock, even at the single neuron level.",

Furthermore, polyamine homeostasis is necessary to cell survival, and its deregulation is involved in relevant processes, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Great efforts have been made to elucidate the nature of polyamine homeostasis, giving rise to relevant information concerning the behavior of the different components of polyamine metabolism, and a great amount of information has been generated. However, a complex regulation at transcriptional, translational, and metabolic levels as well as the strong relationship between polyamines and essential cell processes make it difficult to discriminate the role of polyamine regulation itself from the whole cell response when an experimental approach is given in vivo. To overcome this limitation, a bottom-up approach to model mathematically metabolic pathways could allow us to elucidate the systemic behavior from individual kinetic and molecular properties. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model of polyamine metabolism from kinetic constants and both metabolite and enzyme levels extracted from bibliographic sources. This model captures the tendencies observed in transgenic mice for the so-called key enzymes of polyamine metabolism, ornithine decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermine spermidine N-acetyl transferase. Furthermore, the model shows a relevant role of S-adenosylmethionine and acetyl-CoA availability in polyamine homeostasis, which are not usually considered in systemic experimental studies.",

Our simulations predict nuclear RanGTP levels in HeLa cells to be very sensitive towards the cellular energy charge and to exceed the cytoplasmic concentration approximately 1000-fold. The steepness of the RanGTP gradient appears limited by both the cytoplasmic RanGAP concentration and the imperfect retention of nuclear RanGTP by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), but not by the nucleotide exchange activity of RCC1. Neither RanBP1 nor the NPC localization of RanGAP has a significant direct impact on the RanGTP gradient. NTF2-mediated import of Ran appears to be the bottleneck for maximal capacity of Ran-driven nuclear transport. We show that unidirectional nuclear transport can be faithfully simulated without the assumption of a vectorial NPC passage; transport receptors only need to reversibly cross NPCs and switch their affinity for cargo in response to the RanGTP gradient. A significant RanGTP gradient after nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown can apparently exist only in large cytoplasm. This indicates that RanGTP gradients can provide positional information for mitotic spindle and NE assembly in early embryonic cells, but hardly any in small somatic cells.",

The onset of anaphase, which is initiated by activating the APC, is controlled by the spindle assembly checkpoint (M)SAC. Mad2, which is a constitutive member of the (M)SAC, is supposed to inhibit the activity of the APC by sequestering away its co-activator Cdc20. Mad1 recruits Mad2 to unattached kinetochores and is compulsory for the establishment of the Mad2 and Cdc20 complexes. Recently, based on results from in vivo and in vitro studies, two biochemical models were proposed: the Template and the Exchange model. Here, we derive a mathematical description to compare the dynamical behaviour of the two models. Our simulation analysis supports the Template model. Using experimentally determined values for the model parameters, the Cdc20 concentration is reduced down to only about half. Thus, although the Template model displays good metaphase-to-anaphase switching behaviour, it is not able to completely describe (M)SAC regulation. This situation is neither improved by amplification nor by p31(comet) inhibition. We speculate that either additional reaction partners are required for total inhibition of Cdc20 or an extended mechanism has to be introduced for (M)SAC regulation.",

The enzyme is a heterodimer of homologous subunits in which each subunit binds 1 equiv of 5-coordinate high-spin heme. .NO increases the Vmax of sGC up to 400-fold and has previously been shown to bind to the heme to form a 5-coordinate complex. Using stopped-flow spectrophotometry, it is demonstrated that the binding of .NO to the heme of sGC is a complex process. .NO first binds to the heme to form a 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex, which then converts to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex through one of two ways. For 28 +\/- 4% of the heme, the 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex rapidly (approximately 20 s-1) converts to the 5-coordinate complex. For the remaining 72 +\/- 4% of the heme, the conversion of the 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex is slow (0.1-1.0 s-1) and is dependent upon the interaction of .NO with an unidentified non-heme site on the protein. The heme (200 nM) was completely converted to the 5-coordinate state with as little as 500 nM .NO, and the equilibrium dissociation constant of .NO for activating the enzyme was determined to be < or = 250 nM. Gel-filtration analysis indicates that the binding of .NO to the heme has no effect on the native molecular mass of the protein.

        "abstract":"After initiating NO synthesis a majority of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) quickly partitions into a ferrous heme-NO complex. This down-regulates activity and increases enzyme K(m,O(2)). To understand this process, we developed a 10-step kinetic model in which the ferric heme-NO enzyme forms as the immediate product of catalysis, and then partitions between NO dissociation versus reduction to a ferrous heme-NO complex. Rate constants used for the model were derived from recent literature or were determined here. Computer simulations of the model precisely described both pre-steady and steady-state features of nNOS catalysis, including NADPH consumption and NO production, buildup of a heme-NO complex, changes between pre-steady and steady-state rates, and the change in enzyme K(m,O(2)) in the presence or absence of NO synthesis. The model also correctly simulated the catalytic features of nNOS mutants W409F and W409Y, which are hyperactive and display less heme-NO complex formation in the steady state. Model simulations showed how the rate of heme reduction influences several features of nNOS catalysis, including populations of NO-bound versus NO-free enzyme in the steady state and the rate of NO synthesis. The simulation predicts that there is an optimum rate of heme reduction that is close to the measured rate in nNOS. Ratio between NADPH consumption and NO synthesis is also predicted to increase with faster heme reduction. Our kinetic model is an accurate and versatile tool for understanding catalytic behavior and will provide new perspectives on NOS regulation.",

Mutants in which one or the other of the proteins of this complex are absent, inactive, or expressed at elevated amounts show altered chemotactic behavior and the phenotypes are difficult to interpret for some overexpression mutants. We have examined the possibility that these unexpected phenotypes might arise from the binding steps that lead to active complex formation. A limited genetic algorithm was used to search for sets of binding reactions and associated binding constants expected to give mutant phenotypes in accord with experimental data. Different sets of binding equilibria and different assumptions about the activity of particular receptor complexes were tried. Computer analysis demonstrated that it is possible to obtain sets of binding equilibria consistent with the observed phenotypes and provided a simple explanation for these phenotypes in terms of the distribution of active and inactive complexes formed under various conditions.

        "abstract":"The formation of somites in the course of vertebrate segmentation is governed by an oscillator known as the segmentation clock, which is characterized by a period ranging from 30 min to a few hours depending on the organism. This oscillator permits the synchronized activation of segmentation genes in successive cohorts of cells in the presomitic mesoderm in response to a periodic signal emitted by the segmentation clock, thereby defining the future segments. Recent microarray experiments [Dequeant, M.L., Glynn, E., Gaudenz, K., Wahl, M., Chen, J., Mushegian, A., Pourquie, O., 2006. A complex oscillating network of signaling genes underlies the mouse segmentation clock. Science 314, 1595-1598] indicate that the Notch, Wnt and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways are involved in the mechanism of the segmentation clock. By means of computational modeling, we investigate the conditions in which sustained oscillations occur in these three signaling pathways. First we show that negative feedback mediated by the Lunatic Fringe protein on intracellular Notch activation can give rise to periodic behavior in the Notch pathway. We then show that negative feedback exerted by Axin2 on the degradation of beta-catenin through formation of the Axin2 destruction complex can produce oscillations in the Wnt pathway. Likewise, negative feedback on FGF signaling mediated by the phosphatase product of the gene MKP3\/Dusp6 can produce oscillatory gene expression in the FGF pathway. Coupling the Wnt, Notch and FGF oscillators through common intermediates can lead to synchronized oscillations in the three signaling pathways or to complex periodic behavior, depending on the relative periods of oscillations in the three pathways. The phase relationships between cycling genes in the three pathways depend on the nature of the coupling between the pathways and on their relative autonomous periods. The model provides a framework for analyzing the dynamics of the segmentation clock in terms of a network of oscillating modules involving the Wnt, Notch and FGF signaling pathways.",

A low sustained Ca(2+) influx is observed through the CRAC channels across the plasma membrane. In particular, our model shows that a tetrameric channel complex can effectively regulate the total quantity of the channels and the ratio of the active channels to the total channels, and a period of Ca(2+) oscillation about 29 s is in agreement with published experimental data.

The ordered progression between these phases is achieved thanks to the existence of checkpoint mechanisms based on mutual inhibition of these processes. Here we study a simple theoretical model for oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2 activity, involving mutual inhibition of the two oscillators. Each minimal oscillator is described by a three-variable cascade involving a cdk, together with the associated cyclin and cyclin-degrading enzyme. The dynamics of this skeleton model of coupled oscillators is determined as a function of the strength of their mutual inhibition. The most common mode of dynamic behavior, obtained under conditions of strong mutual inhibition, is that of alternating oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2, which correspond to the physiological situation of the ordered recurrence of the M and S phases. In addition, for weaker inhibition we obtain evidence for a variety of dynamic phenomena such as complex periodic oscillations, chaos, and the coexistence between multiple periodic or chaotic attractors. We discuss the conditions of occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior, as well as their possible physiological significance.",

We use the model to provide new insights into several different mechanisms of folate homeostasis. The model reproduces the known pool sizes of folate substrates and the fluxes through each of the loops of the folate cycle and has the qualitative behavior observed in a variety of experimental studies. Vitamin B(12) deficiency, modeled as a reduction in the V(max) of the methionine synthase reaction, results in a secondary folate deficiency via the accumulation of folate as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (the \"methyl trap\"). One form of homeostasis is revealed by the fact that a 100-fold up-regulation of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase (known to occur at the G(1)\/S transition) dramatically increases pyrimidine production without affecting the other reactions of the folate cycle. The model also predicts that an almost total inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is required to significantly inhibit the thymidylate synthase reaction, consistent with experimental and clinical studies on the effects of methotrexate. Sensitivity to variation in enzymatic parameters tends to be local in the cycle and inversely proportional to the number of reactions that interconvert two folate substrates. Another form of homeostasis is a consequence of the nonenzymatic binding of folate substrates to folate enzymes. Without folate binding, the velocities of the reactions decrease approximately linearly as total folate is decreased. In the presence of folate binding and allosteric inhibition, the velocities show a remarkable constancy as total folate is decreased.",

We use mathematical modeling to analyze the expression kinetics of T-bet, interferon-gamma, and the IL-12 receptor beta2 chain (IL-12Rbeta2) during Th1 cell differentiation, in the presence or absence of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma signaling. We show that interferon-gamma induced initial T-bet expression, whereas IL-12Rbeta2 was repressed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The termination of TCR signaling permitted upregulation of IL-12Rbeta2 by T-bet and interleukin-12 signaling that maintained T-bet expression. This late expression of T-bet, accompanied by the upregulation of the transcription factors Runx3 and Hlx, was required to imprint the Th cell for interferon-gamma re-expression. Thus initial polarization and subsequent imprinting of Th1 cells are mediated by interlinked, sequentially acting positive feedback loops of TCR-interferon-gamma-Stat1-T-bet and interleukin-12-Stat4-T-bet signaling.",

        "abstract":"Robust oscillatory behaviors are common features of circadian and cell cycle rhythms. These cyclic processes, however, behave distinctively in terms of their periods and phases in response to external influences such as light, temperature, nutrients, etc. Nevertheless, several links have been found between these two oscillators. Cell division cycles gated by the circadian clock have been observed since the late 1950s. On the other hand, ionizing radiation (IR) treatments cause cells to undergo a DNA damage response, which leads to phase shifts (mostly advances) in circadian rhythms. Circadian gating of the cell cycle can be attributed to the cell cycle inhibitor kinase Wee1 (which is regulated by the heterodimeric circadian clock transcription factor, BMAL1\/CLK), and possibly in conjunction with other cell cycle components that are known to be regulated by the circadian clock (i.e., c-Myc and cyclin D1). It has also been shown that DNA damage-induced activation of the cell cycle regulator, Chk2, leads to phosphorylation and destruction of a circadian clock component (i.e., PER1 in Mus or FRQ in Neurospora crassa). However, the molecular mechanism underlying how DNA damage causes predominantly phase advances in the circadian clock remains unknown. In order to address this question, we employ mathematical modeling to simulate different phase response curves (PRCs) from either dexamethasone (Dex) or IR treatment experiments. Dex is known to synchronize circadian rhythms in cell culture and may generate both phase advances and delays. We observe unique phase responses with minimum delays of the circadian clock upon DNA damage when two criteria are met: (1) existence of an autocatalytic positive feedback mechanism in addition to the time-delayed negative feedback loop in the clock system and (2) Chk2-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of PERs that are not bound to BMAL1\/CLK.",

        "abstract":"Ammonium assimilation in Escherichia coli is regulated through multiple mechanisms (metabolic, signal transduction leading to covalent modification, transcription, and translation), which (in-)directly affect the activities of its two ammonium-assimilating enzymes, i.e. glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Much is known about the kinetic properties of the components of the regulatory network that these enzymes are part of, but the ways in which, and the extents to which the network leads to subtle and quasi-intelligent regulation are unappreciated. To determine whether our present knowledge of the interactions between and the kinetic properties of the components of this network is complete - to the extent that when integrated in a kinetic model it suffices to calculate observed physiological behaviour - we now construct a kinetic model of this network, based on all of the kinetic data on the components that is available in the literature. We use this model to analyse regulation of ammonium assimilation at various carbon statuses for cells that have adapted to low and high ammonium concentrations. We show how a sudden increase in ammonium availability brings about a rapid redirection of the ammonium assimilation flux from GS\/glutamate synthase (GOGAT) to GDH. The extent of redistribution depends on the nitrogen and carbon status of the cell. We develop a method to quantify the relative importance of the various regulators in the network. We find the importance is shared among regulators. We confirm that the adenylylation state of GS is the major regulator but that a total of 40% of the regulation is mediated by ADP (22%), glutamate (10%), glutamine (7%) and ATP (1%). The total steady-state ammonium assimilation flux is remarkably robust against changes in the ammonium concentration, but the fluxes through GS and GDH are completely nonrobust. Gene expression of GOGAT above a threshold value makes expression of GS under ammonium-limited conditions, and of GDH under glucose-limited conditions, sufficient for ammonium assimilation.",

Using a combination of live-cell reporters, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, we find that initiator caspases are active during the long and variable delay that precedes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and effector caspase activation. When combined with a mathematical model of core apoptosis pathways, experimental perturbation of regulatory links between initiator and effector caspases reveals that XIAP and proteasome-dependent degradation of effector caspases are important in restraining activity during the pre-MOMP delay. We identify conditions in which restraint is impaired, creating a physiologically indeterminate state of partial cell death with the potential to generate genomic instability. Together, these findings provide a quantitative picture of caspase regulatory networks and their failure modes.",

The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and\/or GAPD activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and\/or GAPD activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible. The theoretical results presented in this study apply to the study of insulin secretion mechanisms, since glycolytic oscillations have been proposed as a cause of oscillations in the ATP\/ADP ratio which is linked to insulin secretion.",

Mutations in this network may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Bifurcation analysis helps to identify the key components of this extremely complex interaction network. RESULTS: We identify various positive and negative feedback loops in the network controlling the G1\/S transition. It is shown that the positive feedback regulation of E2F1 and a double activator-inhibitor module can lead to bistability. Extensions of the core module preserve the essential features such as bistability. The complete model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in addition to bistability. We relate these bifurcations to the cell cycle checkpoint and the G1\/S phase transition point. Thus, core modules can explain major features of the complex G1\/S network and have a robust decision taking function.",

Single-parameter bifurcation analysis was used to evaluate the stability robustness of the limit cycle oscillation as well as the frequency and amplitude of oscillations. A tool from control engineering--the structural singular value (SSV)--was used to quantify robust stability of the limit cycle. Using SSV analysis, we find very poor robustness when the model's parameters are allowed to vary.

A key step in the evolution towards a more quantitative understanding of signalling is to specify explicitly the kinetics of all chemical reaction steps in a pathway. We have reconstructed a model of the nuclear factor, kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway, containing 64 parameters and 26 variables, including steps in which the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor is intimately associated with the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of its inhibitor kappaB by a membrane-associated kinase, and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We apply sensitivity analysis to the model. This identifies those parameters in this (IkappaB)\/NF-kappaB signalling system (containing only induced IkappaBalpha isoform) that most affect the oscillatory concentration of nuclear NF-kappaB (in terms of both period and amplitude). The intention is to provide guidance on which proteins are likely to be most significant as drug targets or should be exploited for further, more detailed experiments. The sensitivity coefficients were found to be strongly dependent upon the magnitude of the parameter change studied, indicating the highly non-linear nature of the system. Of the 64 parameters in the model, only eight to nine exerted a major control on nuclear NF-kappaB oscillations, and each of these involved as reaction participants either the IkappaB kinase (IKK) or IkappaBalpha, directly.

The system contains the enzymes S-acetyl coenzyme A synthetase, adenylate kinase and pyruvate kinase, and converts ATP into AMP, then into ADP and finally back to ATP. L-Lactate dehydrogenase is added to the system to enable continuous monitoring of the progress of the reaction. The cycle cannot work when the only recycling substrate in the reaction medium is AMP. A mathematical model is proposed whose kinetic behavior has been analyzed both numerically by integration of the nonlinear differential equations describing the kinetics of the reactions involved, and analytically under steady-state conditions, with good agreement with the experimental results being obtained. The data obtained showed that there is a threshold value of the S-acetyl coenzyme A synthetase\/adenylate kinase ratio, above which the cycle stops because all the recycling substrate has been accumulated as AMP, never reaching the steady state. In addition, the concept of adenylate energy charge has been applied to the system, obtaining the enabled values of the rate constants for a fixed adenylate energy charge value and vice versa.",

So far biologists identified two necessary conditions for bistability: positive feedback and ultrasensitivity.Biological systems are based upon elementary mono- and bimolecular chemical reactions. In order to definitely clarify all necessary conditions for bistability we here present the corresponding minimal system. According to our definition, it contains the minimal number of (i) reactants, (ii) reactions, and (iii) terms in the corresponding ordinary differential equations (decreasing importance from i-iii). The minimal bistable system contains two reactants and four irreversible reactions (three bimolecular, one monomolecular).We discuss the roles of the reactions with respect to the necessary conditions for bistability: two reactions comprise the positive feedback loop, a third reaction filters out small stimuli thus enabling a stable 'off' state, and the fourth reaction prevents explosions. We argue that prevention of explosion is a third general necessary condition for bistability, which is so far lacking discussion in the literature.Moreover, in addition to proving that in two-component systems three steady states are necessary for bistability (five for tristability, etc.), we also present a simple general method to design such systems: one just needs one production and three different degradation mechanisms (one production, five degradations for tristability, etc.). This helps modelling multistable systems and it is important for corresponding synthetic biology projects.The presented minimal bistable system finally clarifies the often discussed question for the necessary conditions for bistability. The three necessary conditions are: positive feedback, a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent explosions. This is important for modelling bistability with simple systems and for synthetically designing new bistable systems. Our simple model system is also well suited for corresponding teaching purposes.",

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gemcitabine was given thrice weekly on days 1 and 8 in combination with carboplatin, which was given only on day 1 of every cycle. Gemcitabine amount in the body and area under the concentration-time curves of plasma gemcitabine, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine, and intracellular gemcitabine triphosphate in white cells were compared to determine which best describes tumor shrinkage over time. Tumor growth kinetics were described using a Gompertz-like model. RESULTS: The apparent half-life for the effect of gemcitabine was 7.67 weeks. The tumor turnover time constant was 21.8 week.cm. Baseline tumor size and gemcitabine amount in the body to attain 50% of tumor shrinkage were estimated to be 6.66 cm and 10,600 mg. There was no evidence of relapse during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Concentration-based exposure metrics for gemcitabine and its metabolites were no better than gemcitabine amount in predicting tumor shrinkage in primary lung cancer lesions. Gemcitabine dose-based models did marginally better than treatment-based models that ignored doses of drug administered to patients.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) control the differentiation, specification and function of cells at the genomic level. The levels of interactions within large GRNs are of enormous depth and complexity. Details about many GRNs are emerging, but in most cases it is unknown to what extent they control a given process, i.e. the grade of completeness is uncertain. This uncertainty stems from limited experimental data, which is the main bottleneck for creating detailed dynamical models of cellular processes. Parameter estimation for each node is often infeasible for very large GRNs. We propose a method, based on random parameter estimations through Monte-Carlo simulations to measure completeness grades of GRNs. RESULTS: We developed a heuristic to assess the completeness of large GRNs, using ODE simulations under different conditions and randomly sampled parameter sets to detect parameter-invariant effects of perturbations. To test this heuristic, we constructed the first ODE model of the whole sea urchin endomesoderm GRN, one of the best studied large GRNs. We find that nearly 48% of the parameter-invariant effects correspond with experimental data, which is 65% of the expected optimal agreement obtained from a submodel for which kinetic parameters were estimated and used for simulations. Randomized versions of the model reproduce only 23.5% of the experimental data. CONCLUSION: The method described in this paper enables an evaluation of network topologies of GRNs without requiring any parameter values. The benefit of this method is exemplified in the first mathematical analysis of the complete Endomesoderm Network Model. The predictions we provide deliver candidate nodes in the network that are likely to be erroneous or miss unknown connections, which may need additional experiments to improve the network topology. This mathematical model can serve as a scaffold for detailed and more realistic models. We propose that our method can be used to assess a completeness grade of any GRN. This could be especially useful for GRNs involved in human diseases, where often the amount of connectivity is unknown and\/or many genes\/interactions are missing.",

The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and\/or GAPD activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and\/or GAPD activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible. The theoretical results presented in this study apply to the study of insulin secretion mechanisms, since glycolytic oscillations have been proposed as a cause of oscillations in the ATP\/ADP ratio which is linked to insulin secretion.",

This is achieved by wiring signalling pathways such that they can interact with each other, a phenomenon often called crosstalk. In this study, we employ mathematical modelling techniques to analyse dynamic mechanisms and measures of crosstalk. We present a dynamic mathematical model that compiles current knowledge about the wiring of the pheromone pathway and the filamentous growth pathway in yeast. We consider the main dynamic features and the interconnections between the two pathways in order to study dynamic crosstalk between these two pathways in haploid cells. We introduce two new measures of dynamic crosstalk, the intrinsic specificity and the extrinsic specificity. These two measures incorporate the combined signal of several stimuli being present simultaneously and seem to be more stable than previous measures. When both pathways are responsive and stimulated, the model predicts that (a) the filamentous growth pathway amplifies the response of the pheromone pathway, and (b) the pheromone pathway inhibits the response of filamentous growth pathway in terms of mitogen activated protein kinase activity and transcriptional activity, respectively. Among several mechanisms we identified leakage of activated Ste11 as the most influential source of crosstalk. Moreover, we propose new experiments and predict their outcomes in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of crosstalk between the two pathways. Studying signals that are transmitted in parallel gives us new insights about how pathways and signals interact in a dynamical way, e.g., whether they amplify, inhibit, delay or accelerate each other.",

The model consists of 44 enzymatic reactions, 59 metabolic state variables, and 272 parameters. It integrates five subsystems: glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the respiratory chain, NADH shuttles, and the pyruvate cycle. It also takes into account compartmentalization of the reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix. The model shows expected behavior in its outputs, including the response of ATP production to starting glucose concentration and the induction of oscillations of metabolite concentrations in the glycolytic pathway and in ATP and ADP concentrations. Identification of choke points and parameter sensitivity analysis indicate that the glycolytic pathway, and to a lesser extent the TCA cycle, are critical to the proper behavior of the system, while parameters in other components such as the respiratory chain are less critical. Notably, however, sensitivity analysis identifies the first reactions of nonglycolytic pathways as being important for the behavior of the system. The model is robust to deletion of malic enzyme activity, which is absent in mouse pancreatic beta cells. The model represents a step toward the construction of a model with species-specific parameters that can be used to understand mouse models of diabetes and the relationship of these mouse models to the human disease state.",

To examine the expression patterns of non-sporulating cells within heterogeneous populations, we used buoyant density centrifugation to separate vegetative cells from endospore-containing cells and compared the transcriptome profiles of both subpopulations. This demonstrated the differential expression of various regulons. Subsequent single-cell analyses using promoter-gfp fusions confirmed our microarray results. Surprisingly, only part of the vegetative subpopulation highly and transiently expresses genes encoding the extracellular proteases Bpr (bacillopeptidase) and AprE (subtilisin), both of which are under the control of the DegU transcriptional regulator. As these proteases and their degradation products freely diffuse within the liquid growth medium, all cells within the clonal population are expected to benefit from their activities, suggesting that B. subtilis employs cooperative or even altruistic behavior. To unravel the mechanisms by which protease production heterogeneity within the non-sporulating subpopulation is established, we performed a series of genetic experiments combined with mathematical modeling. Simulations with our model yield valuable insights into how population heterogeneity may arise by the relatively long and variable response times within the DegU autoactivating pathway.",

Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia coli's central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli's central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect recognition of carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources.",

In a first attempt to reconcile these two approaches, we developed a simple modelling framework where two strains of pathogens, defined by a pair of life-history traits (infectious period and infectivity), interfere through a given level of cross-immunity. We used whooping cough as a potential example, but the framework proposed here could be applied to other acute infectious diseases. Specifically, we analysed the effects of these parameters on the invasion dynamics of one strain into a population, where the second strain is endemic. Whereas the deterministic version of the model converges towards stable coexistence of the two strains in most cases, stochastic simulations showed that transient epidemic dynamics can cause the extinction of either strain. Thus ecological dynamics, modulated by the immune parameters, eventually determine the adaptive value of different pathogen genotypes. We advocate an integrative view of pathogen dynamics at the crossroads of immunology, epidemiology and evolution, as a way towards efficient control of infectious diseases.",

Yet, the pathway is flexible enough to produce different downstream gene expression patterns in response to different stresses.We construct a mathematical model of the negative feedback loop involving p53 and its inhibitor, Mdm2, at the core of this pathway, and use it to examine the effect of different stresses that trigger p53. In response to DNA damage, hypoxia, etc., the model exhibits a wide variety of specific output behaviour - steady states with low or high levels of p53 and Mdm2, as well as spiky oscillations with low or high average p53 levels.We show that even a simple negative feedback loop is capable of exhibiting the kind of flexible stress-specific response observed in the p53 system. Further, our model provides a framework for predicting the differences in p53 response to different stresses and single nucleotide polymorphisms.",

The ubiquity of pathways that possess an initial activation step, suggests that there might be many more genes that, when deleted, cause rather paradoxical regulation phenotypes (i.e. growth defects caused by enhanced utilization of growth substrate).",

Under certain conditions the concentrations of the glycolytic intermediates in yeast cells can oscillate. Individual yeast cells in a suspension can synchronize their oscillations to get in phase with each other. Although the glycolytic oscillations originate in the upper part of the glycolytic chain, the signaling agent in this synchronization appears to be acetaldehyde, a membrane-permeating metabolite at the bottom of the anaerobic part of the glycolytic chain. Here we address the issue of how a metabolite remote from the pacemaking origin of the oscillation may nevertheless control the synchronization. We present a quantitative model for glycolytic oscillations and their synchronization in terms of chemical kinetics. We show that, in essence, the common acetaldehyde concentration can be modeled as a small perturbation on the \"pacemaker\" whose effect on the period of the oscillations of cells in the same suspension is indeed such that a synchronization develops.",

We show here that a simple (M,R)-system consisting of three interlocking catalytic cycles, with every catalyst produced by the system itself, can both establish a non-trivial steady state and maintain this despite continuous loss of the catalysts by irreversible degradation. As long as at least one catalyst is present at a sufficient concentration in the initial state, the others can be produced and maintained. The system shows bistability, because if the amount of catalyst in the initial state is insufficient to reach the non-trivial steady state the system collapses to a trivial steady state in which all fluxes are zero. It is also robust, because if one catalyst is catastrophically lost when the system is in steady state it can recreate the same state. There are three elementary flux modes, but none of them is an enzyme-maintaining mode, the entire network being necessary to maintain the two catalysts.",

However, it was recently shown that bistability and hysteresis can also arise solely from multisite phosphorylation. Here we analytically demonstrate that double phosphorylation of a protein (or other covalent modification) generates bistability only if: (a) the two phosphorylation (or the two dephosphorylation) reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme; (b) the kinetics operate at least partly in the zero-order region; and (c) the ratio of the catalytic constants of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps in the first modification cycle is less than this ratio in the second cycle. We also show that multisite phosphorylation enlarges the region of kinetic parameter values in which bistability appears, but does not generate multistability. In addition, we conclude that a cascade of phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation cycles generates multiple steady states in the absence of feedback or feedforward loops. Our results show that bistable behavior in covalent modification cascades relies not only on the structure and regulatory pattern of feedback\/feedforward loops, but also on the kinetic characteristics of their component proteins.",

Normally found in growing yeast cells and other organisms only as traces, trehalose becomes a crucial protector of proteins and membranes against a variety of stresses, including heat, cold, starvation, desiccation, osmotic or oxidative stress, and exposure to toxicants. Trehalose is produced from glucose 6-phosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose in a two-step process, and recycled to glucose by trehalases. Even though the trehalose cycle consists of only a few metabolites and enzymatic steps, its regulatory structure and operation are surprisingly complex. The article begins with a review of experimental observations on the regulation of the trehalose cycle in yeast and proposes a canonical model for its analysis. The first part of this analysis demonstrates the benefits of the various regulatory features by means of controlled comparisons with models of otherwise equivalent pathways lacking these features. The second part elucidates the significance of the expression pattern of the trehalose cycle genes in response to heat shock. Interestingly, the genes contributing to trehalose formation are up-regulated to very different degrees, and even the trehalose degrading trehalases show drastically increased activity during heat-shock response. Again using the method of controlled comparisons, the model provides rationale for the observed pattern of gene expression and reveals benefits of the counterintuitive trehalase up-regulation.",

        "abstract":"Experimental studies have demonstrated that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT\/A) causes flaccid paralysis by a multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve endings, BoNT\/A is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently its zinc-dependent catalytic domain translocates into the neuroplasm where it cleaves a vesicle-docking protein, SNAP-25, to block neurally evoked cholinergic neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data concerning the onset of paralysis of skeletal muscles induced by BoNT\/A at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories were simulated with two different models that were represented by sets of coupled, first-order differential equations. In this study, the 3-step sequential model developed by Simpson (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 212:16-21,1980) was used to estimate upper limits of the times during which anti-toxins and other impermeable inhibitors of BoNT\/A can exert an effect. The experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants for BoNT\/A binding to and dissociating from its receptors. Because this 3-step model was not designed to reproduce temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin concentrations, a new BoNT\/A species and rate (k(S)) were added at the beginning of the reaction sequence to create a 4-step scheme. This unbound initial species is transformed at a rate determined by k(S) to a free species that is capable of binding. By systematically adjusting the values of k(S), the 4-step model simulated the rapid decline in NMJ function (k(S) >or= 0.01), the less rapid onset of paralysis in mice following i.m. injections (k (S) = 0.001), and the slow onset of the therapeutic effects of BoNT\/A (k(S) < 0.001) in man. This minimal modeling approach was not only verified by simulating experimental results, it helped to quantitatively define the time available for an inhibitor to have some effect (t(inhib)) and the relation between this time and the rate of paralysis onset. The 4-step model predicted that as the rate of paralysis becomes slower, the estimated upper limits of (t(inhib)) for impermeable inhibitors become longer. More generally, this modeling approach may be useful in studying the kinetics of other toxins or viruses that invade host cells by similar mechanisms, e.g., receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

Deficits in glutathione have been implicated in aging and a host of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, Down syndrome and autism.We explore the properties of glutathione metabolism in the liver by experimenting with a mathematical model of one-carbon metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway, and glutathione synthesis, transport, and breakdown. The model is based on known properties of the enzymes and the regulation of those enzymes by oxidative stress. We explore the half-life of glutathione, the regulation of glutathione synthesis, and its sensitivity to fluctuations in amino acid input. We use the model to simulate the metabolic profiles previously observed in Down syndrome and autism and compare the model results to clinical data.We show that the glutathione pools in hepatic cells and in the blood are quite insensitive to fluctuations in amino acid input and offer an explanation based on model predictions. In contrast, we show that hepatic glutathione pools are highly sensitive to the level of oxidative stress. The model shows that overexpression of genes on chromosome 21 and an increase in oxidative stress can explain the metabolic profile of Down syndrome. The model also correctly simulates the metabolic profile of autism when oxidative stress is substantially increased and the adenosine concentration is raised.

Several aspects of its growth, turnover, and mechanism, occur in the absence of gonadal hormones. Sex steroids such as estrogen, nonetheless, play an important role in bone physiology, and are extremely essential to maintain bone balance in adults. In order to provide a basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of bone remodeling as it is mediated by PTH, we propose here a mathematical model of the process. The nonlinear system model is then utilized to study the temporal effect of PTH as well as the action of estrogen replacement therapy on bone turnover. Analysis of the model is done on the assumption, supported by reported clinical evidence, that the process is characterized by highly diversified dynamics, which warrants the use of singular perturbation arguments. The model is shown to exhibit limit cycle behavior, which can develop into chaotic dynamics for certain ranges of the system's parametric values. Effects of estrogen and PTH administrations are then investigated by extending on the core model. Analysis of the model seems to indicate that the paradoxical observation that intermittent PTH administration causes net bone deposition while continuous administration causes net bone loss, and certain other reported phenomena may be attributed to the highly diversified dynamics which characterizes this nonlinear remodeling process.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) is implicated in both sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer's disease. The transcription factor, p53 also plays a role and has been linked to an increase in tau hyperphosphorylation although the effect is indirect. There is also evidence that GSK3beta and p53 interact and that the activity of both proteins is increased as a result of this interaction. Under normal cellular conditions, p53 is kept at low levels by Mdm2 but when cells are stressed, p53 is stabilised and may then interact with GSK3beta. We propose that this interaction has an important contribution to cellular outcomes and to test this hypothesis we developed a stochastic simulation model. RESULTS: The model predicts that high levels of DNA damage leads to increased activity of p53 and GSK3beta and low levels of aggregation but if DNA damage is repaired, the aggregates are eventually cleared. The model also shows that over long periods of time, aggregates may start to form due to stochastic events leading to increased levels of ROS and damaged DNA. This is followed by increased activity of p53 and GSK3beta and a vicious cycle ensues. CONCLUSIONS: Since p53 and GSK3beta are both involved in the apoptotic pathway, and GSK3beta overactivity leads to increased levels of plaques and tangles, our model might explain the link between protein aggregation and neuronal loss in neurodegeneration.",

The pathways leading to establishment of senescence are proving to be more complex than was previously envisaged. Combining in-silico interactome analysis and functional target gene inhibition, stochastic modelling and live cell microscopy, we show here that there exists a dynamic feedback loop that is triggered by a DNA damage response (DDR) and, which after a delay of several days, locks the cell into an actively maintained state of 'deep' cellular senescence. The essential feature of the loop is that long-term activation of the checkpoint gene CDKN1A (p21) induces mitochondrial dysfunction and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through serial signalling through GADD45-MAPK14(p38MAPK)-GRB2-TGFBR2-TGFbeta. These ROS in turn replenish short-lived DNA damage foci and maintain an ongoing DDR. We show that this loop is both necessary and sufficient for the stability of growth arrest during the establishment of the senescent phenotype.",

The model produces oscillations of observed damping and period in ATP and NADP concentrations which are about 180 degrees out of phase, while three alternative proposals regarding coupling of electron transport and photophosphorylation do not produce oscillatory model solutions. The phases of ATP and NADPH are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data. The model (which assumes that redox control of photophosphorylation is part of the oscillatory mechanism) is compared with an alternative proposal (that oscillations are due to interdependence of turnover of adenylates and Calvin cycle intermediates).

The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation.

Among other predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity.

For Drosophila, the molecular model is based on the negative feedback exerted on the expression of the per and tim genes by the complex formed between the PER and TIM proteins. For Neurospora, similarly, the model relies on the feedback exerted on the expression of the frq gene by its protein product FRQ. In both models, sustained rhythmic variations in protein and mRNA levels occur in continuous darkness, in the form of limit cycle oscillations. The effect of light on circadian rhythms is taken into account in the models by considering that it triggers degradation of the TIM protein in Drosophila, and frq transcription in Neurospora. When incorporating the control exerted by light at the molecular level, we show that the models can account for the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light-dark cycles and for the damping of the oscillations in constant light, though such damping occurs more readily in the Drosophila model. The models account for the phase shifts induced by light pulses and allow the construction of phase response curves. These compare well with experimental results obtained in Drosophila. The model for Drosophila shows that when applied at the appropriate phase, light pulses of appropriate duration and magnitude can permanently or transiently suppress circadian rhythmicity. We investigate the effects of the magnitude of light-induced changes on oscillatory behavior. Finally, we discuss the common and distinctive features of circadian oscillations in the two organisms.",

However, insufficient or excessive complement activation will lead to immune-related diseases. It is so far unknown how the complement activity is up- or down- regulated and what the associated pathophysiological mechanisms are. To quantitatively understand the modulatory mechanisms of the complement system, we built a computational model involving the enhancement and suppression mechanisms that regulate complement activity. Our model consists of a large system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) accompanied by a dynamic Bayesian network as a probabilistic approximation of the ODE dynamics. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, this approximation was used to perform parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis. Our combined computational and experimental study showed that the antimicrobial response is sensitive to changes in pH and calcium levels, which determines the strength of the crosstalk between CRP and L-ficolin. Our study also revealed differential regulatory effects of C4BP. While C4BP delays but does not decrease the classical complement activation, it attenuates but does not significantly delay the lectin pathway activation. We also found that the major inhibitory role of C4BP is to facilitate the decay of C3 convertase. In summary, the present work elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the complement system and demonstrates how the bio-pathway machinery maintains the balance between activation and inhibition. The insights we have gained could contribute to the development of therapies targeting the complement system.",

Experimental evidence indicates that this phenomenon is due to the interaction of multiple conductances with very different kinetics, and the model incorporates this evidence. As a parameter is varied the model undergoes a transition between two oscillatory waveforms; a corresponding transition is observed experimentally. After establishing the periodicity of the subcritical oscillatory solution, the nature of the transition is studied. It is found to be a resonance bifurcation, with the solution branching at the critical point to another periodic solution of the same period. Using this result a comparison is made between the model and experimental observations. The model is found to predict and allow an interpretation of these observations.",

Recent advances in data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.",

Based on plasma concentrations the kinetics of L-dopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), benserazide, and its metabolite Ro 04-5127 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis and a compartmental model where total L-dopa clearance was the sum of the clearances mediated by amino-acid-decarboxylase (AADC), catechol-O-methyltransferase and other enzymes.

A simplified analog of genetic regulatory networks, in vitro transcriptional circuits, provides a modular platform for the systematic construction of arbitrary circuits and requires only two essential enzymes, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and Escherichia coli ribonuclease H, to produce and degrade RNA signals. In this study, we design and experimentally demonstrate three transcriptional oscillators in vitro. First, a negative feedback oscillator comprising two switches, regulated by excitatory and inhibitory RNA signals, showed up to five complete cycles. To demonstrate modularity and to explore the design space further, a positive-feedback loop was added that modulates and extends the oscillatory regime. Finally, a three-switch ring oscillator was constructed and analyzed. Mathematical modeling guided the design process, identified experimental conditions likely to yield oscillations, and explained the system's robust response to interference by short degradation products. Synthetic transcriptional oscillators could prove valuable for systematic exploration of biochemical circuit design principles and for controlling nanoscale devices and orchestrating processes within artificial cells.",

Here, we present a strategy for reversible switch design that instead relies only on a robust, easily constructed network topology with two positive feedback loops and we apply the method to create highly ultrasensitive (n(H)>20), bistable cellular responses to a synthetic ligand\/receptor complex. Independent modulation of the two feedback strengths enables rational tuning and some decoupling of steady-state (ultrasensitivity, signal amplitude, switching threshold, and bistability) and kinetic (rates of system activation and deactivation) response properties. Our integrated computational and synthetic biology approach elucidates design rules for building cellular switches with desired properties, which may be of utility in engineering signal-transduction pathways.",

Amongst others, it is severely influenced by the properties and inter-individual variability of the enzymes and transporters of the drug detoxification system of the liver. Predicting individual drug biotransformation capacity requires quantitative and detailed models. RESULTS: In this contribution we present the de novo deterministic modeling of atorvastatin biotransformation based on comprehensive published knowledge on involved metabolic and transport pathways as well as physicochemical properties. The model was evaluated on primary human hepatocytes and parameter identifiability analysis was performed under multiple experimental constraints. Dynamic simulations of atorvastatin biotransformation considering the inter-individual variability of the two major involved enzymes CYP3A4 and UGT1A3 based on quantitative protein expression data in a large human liver bank (n = 150) highlighted the variability in the individual biotransformation profiles and therefore also points to the individuality of pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: A dynamic model for the biotransformation of atorvastatin has been developed using quantitative metabolite measurements in primary human hepatocytes. The model comprises kinetics for transport processes and metabolic enzymes as well as population liver expression data allowing us to assess the impact of inter-individual variability of concentrations of key proteins. Application of computational tools for parameter sensitivity analysis enabled us to considerably improve the validity of the model and to create a consistent framework for precise computer-aided simulations in toxicology.",

After the discovery of calcium oscillations, one likely mechanism is that information is encoded in the frequency, amplitude and waveform of the oscillations. This hypothesis has received some experimental support. However, the mechanism of decoding of oscillatory signals is still not known. Here, we study a mechanistic model of calcium oscillations, which is able to reproduce both spiking and bursting calcium oscillations. We use the model to study the decoding of calcium signals on the basis of co-operativity of calcium binding to various proteins. We show that this co-operativity offers a simple way to decode different calcium dynamics into different enzyme activities.",

This trade-off may result in an evolutionary dilemma, because cells with a higher rate but lower yield of ATP production may gain a selective advantage when competing for shared energy resources. Using an analysis of model simulations and biochemical observations, we show that ATP production with a low rate and high yield can be viewed as a form of cooperative resource use and may evolve in spatially structured environments. Furthermore, we argue that the high ATP yield of respiration may have facilitated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to undifferentiated multicellular organisms.",

This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a \"physiological state diagram,\" with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models.

The specific contributions of individual feedback regulators, however, remain unclear. Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we established a dynamic pathway model to dissect the roles of the two transcriptional negative feedback regulators of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, CIS and SOCS3, in JAK2\/STAT5 signaling. Facilitated by the model, we calculated the STAT5 response for experimentally unobservable Epo concentrations and provide a quantitative link between cell survival and the integrated response of STAT5 in the nucleus. Model predictions show that the two feedbacks CIS and SOCS3 are most effective at different ligand concentration ranges due to their distinct inhibitory mechanisms. This divided function of dual feedback regulation enables control of STAT5 responses for Epo concentrations that can vary 1000-fold in vivo. Our modeling approach reveals dose-dependent feedback control as key property to regulate STAT5-mediated survival decisions over a broad range of ligand concentrations.",

It is still unclear, however, precisely how auxin is distributed across tissues and how the hormone is sensed in space and time. The control of gene expression in response to auxin involves a complex network of over 50 potentially interacting transcriptional activators and repressors, the auxin response factors (ARFs) and Aux\/IAAs. Here, we perform a large-scale analysis of the Aux\/IAA-ARF pathway in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis, where dynamic auxin-based patterning controls organogenesis. A comprehensive expression map and full interactome uncovered an unexpectedly simple distribution and structure of this pathway in the shoot apex. A mathematical model of the Aux\/IAA-ARF network predicted a strong buffering capacity along with spatial differences in auxin sensitivity. We then tested and confirmed these predictions using a novel auxin signalling sensor that reports input into the signalling pathway, in conjunction with the published DR5 transcriptional output reporter. Our results provide evidence that the auxin signalling network is essential to create robust patterns at the shoot apex.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Higher plants and algae are able to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store this fixed carbon in large quantities as starch, which can be hydrolyzed into sugars serving as feedstock for fermentation to biofuels and precursors. Rational engineering of carbon flow in plant cells requires a greater understanding of how starch breakdown fluxes respond to variations in enzyme concentrations, kinetic parameters, and metabolite concentrations. We have therefore developed and simulated a detailed kinetic ordinary differential equation model of the degradation pathways for starch synthesized in plants and green algae, which to our knowledge is the most complete such model reported to date. RESULTS: Simulation with 9 internal metabolites and 8 external metabolites, the concentrations of the latter fixed at reasonable biochemical values, leads to a single reference solution showing \u03b2-amylase activity to be the rate-limiting step in carbon flow from starch degradation. Additionally, the response coefficients for stromal glucose to the glucose transporter k(cat) and KM are substantial, whereas those for cytosolic glucose are not, consistent with a kinetic bottleneck due to transport. Response coefficient norms show stromal maltopentaose and cytosolic glucosylated arabinogalactan to be the most and least globally sensitive metabolites, respectively, and \u03b2-amylase k(cat) and KM for starch to be the kinetic parameters with the largest aggregate effect on metabolite concentrations as a whole. The latter kinetic parameters, together with those for glucose transport, have the greatest effect on stromal glucose, which is a precursor for biofuel synthetic pathways. Exploration of the steady-state solution space with respect to concentrations of 6 external metabolites and 8 dynamic metabolite concentrations show that stromal metabolism is strongly coupled to starch levels, and that transport between compartments serves to lower coupling between metabolic subsystems in different compartments. CONCLUSIONS: We find that in the reference steady state, starch cleavage is the most significant determinant of carbon flux, with turnover of oligosaccharides playing a secondary role. Independence of stationary point with respect to initial dynamic variable values confirms a unique stationary point in the phase space of dynamically varying concentrations of the model network. Stromal maltooligosaccharide metabolism was highly coupled to the available starch concentration. From the most highly converged trajectories, distances between unique fixed points of phase spaces show that cytosolic maltose levels depend on the total concentrations of arabinogalactan and glucose present in the cytosol. In addition, cellular compartmentalization serves to dampen much, but not all, of the effects of one subnetwork on another, such that kinetic modeling of single compartments would likely capture most dynamics that are fast on the timescale of the transport reactions.",

The goal of the current study was to evaluate the influence of trace amounts of key coagulation proteases on tissue factor-independent thrombin generation using three models of coagulation. With procoagulants and select coagulation inhibitors at mean physiological concentrations, concentrations of factor IXa, factor Xa, and thrombin were set either equal to those of their AP or to values that would result based upon the rates of AP\/enzyme generation and steady state enzyme inhibition. In the latter case, numerical simulation predicts that sufficient thrombin to produce a solid clot would be generated in approximately 2 min. Empirical data from the synthetic plasma suggest clotting times of 3-5 min, which are similar to that observed in contact pathway-inhibited whole blood (4.3 min) initiated with the same concentrations of factors IXa and Xa and thrombin. Numerical simulations performed with the concentrations of two of the enzymes held constant and one varied suggest that the presence of any pair of enzymes is sufficient to yield rapid clot formation. Modeling of states (numerical simulation and whole blood) where only one circulating protease is present at steady state concentration shows significant thrombin generation only for factor IXa. The addition of factor Xa and thrombin has little effect (if any) on thrombin generation induced by factor IXa alone. These data indicate that 1) concentrations of active coagulation enzymes circulating in vivo are significantly lower than can be predicted from the concentrations of their AP, and 2) expected trace amounts of factor IXa can trigger thrombin generation in the absence of tissue factor.",

Such cells can only spike tonically or remain silent when isolated, but can be induced to burst with weak diffusive coupling. With stronger coupling, the cells revert to tonic spiking. We demonstrate that the addition of noise dramatically increases, via a phenomenon like stochastic resonance, the coupling range over which bursting is seen.",

While these diagrams are useful for analyzing biological systems on a large scale, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the observed network connections is critical for the further development of systems and synthetic biology. Here, we use queueing theory to investigate how 'waiting lines' can lead to correlations between protein 'customers' that are coupled solely through a downstream set of enzymatic 'servers'. Using the E. coli ClpXP degradation machine as a model processing system, we observe significant cross-talk between two networks that are indirectly coupled through a common set of processors. We further illustrate the implications of enzymatic queueing using a synthetic biology application, in which two independent synthetic networks demonstrate synchronized behavior when common ClpXP machinery is overburdened. Our results demonstrate that such post-translational processes can lead to dynamic connections in cellular networks and may provide a mechanistic understanding of existing but currently inexplicable links.",

However, little is known about expression limits of genes required to halt cellular systems. In this study, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we developed a genetic 'tug-of-war' (gTOW) method to assess the overexpression limit of certain genes. Using gTOW, we determined copy number limits for 31 cell-cycle regulators; the limits varied from 1 to >100. Comparison with orthologs of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggested the presence of a conserved fragile core in the eukaryotic cell cycle. Robustness profiles of networks regulating cytokinesis in both yeasts (septation-initiation network (SIN) and mitotic exit network (MEN)) were quite different, probably reflecting differences in their physiologic functions. Fragility in the regulation of GTPase spg1 was due to dosage imbalance against GTPase-activating protein (GAP) byr4. Using the gTOW data, we modified a mathematical model and successfully reproduced the robustness of the S. pombe cell cycle with the model.",

To this end, in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the Cdk counteracting phosphatase Cdc14 is activated. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus by its inhibitor Net1. During anaphase, Cdk- and Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 is thought to release active Cdc14. How Net1 is phosphorylated specifically in anaphase, when mitotic kinase activity starts to decline, has remained unexplained. Here, we show that PP2A(Cdc55) phosphatase keeps Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase. The sister chromatid-separating protease separase, activated at anaphase onset, interacts with and downregulates PP2A(Cdc55), thereby facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2A(Cdc55) downregulation also promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the \"mitotic exit network\" that sustains Cdc14 as Cdk activity declines. These findings allow us to present a new quantitative model for mitotic exit in budding yeast.",

Temperature regulation and entrainment mechanisms of circadian clocks are still poorly understood. To better understand the molecular basis of these processes, we built a mathematical model based on experimental data examining temperature regulation of the circadian RNA-binding protein CHLAMY1 from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, simulating the effect of temperature on the rates by applying the Arrhenius equation. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model is temperature-compensated and can be entrained to temperature cycles of various length and amplitude. The range of periods that allow entrainment of the model depends on the shape of the temperature cycles and is larger for sinusoidal compared to rectangular temperature curves. We show that the response to temperature of protein (de)phosphorylation rates play a key role in facilitating temperature entrainment of the oscillator in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We systematically investigated the response of our model to single temperature pulses to explain experimentally observed phase response curves.",

Cholodny and Went hypothesized over 80 years ago that plants bend in response to a gravity stimulus by generating a lateral gradient of a growth regulator at an organ's apex, later found to be auxin. Auxin regulates root growth by targeting Aux\/IAA repressor proteins for degradation. We used an Aux\/IAA-based reporter, domain II (DII)-VENUS, in conjunction with a mathematical model to quantify auxin redistribution following a gravity stimulus. Our multidisciplinary approach revealed that auxin is rapidly redistributed to the lower side of the root within minutes of a 90\u00b0 gravity stimulus. Unexpectedly, auxin asymmetry was rapidly lost as bending root tips reached an angle of 40\u00b0 to the horizontal. We hypothesize roots use a \"tipping point\" mechanism that operates to reverse the asymmetric auxin flow at the midpoint of root bending. These mechanistic insights illustrate the scientific value of developing quantitative reporters such as DII-VENUS in conjunction with parameterized mathematical models to provide high-resolution kinetics of hormone redistribution.",

Previous studies have examined the effect of using soybean varieties missing one or more of the 3 LOX isozymes on n-hexanal generation. A dynamic mathematical model of the soybean LOX pathway using ordinary differential equations was constructed using parameters estimated from existing data with the aim of predicting how n-hexanal generation could be reduced. Time-course simulations of LOX-null beans were run and compared with experimental results. Model L(2), L(3), and L(12) beans were within the range relative to the wild type found experimentally, with L(13) and L(23) beans close to the experimental range. Model L(1) beans produced much more n-hexanal relative to the wild type than those in experiments. Sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing the estimated K(m) parameter for LOX isozyme 3 (L-3) would improve the fit between model predictions and experimental results found in the literature. The model also predicts that increasing L-3 or reducing L-2 levels within beans may reduce n-hexanal generation.This work describes the use of mathematics to attempt to quantify the enzyme-catalyzed conversions of compounds in soybean homogenates into undesirable flavors, primarily from the compound n-hexanal. The effect of different soybean genotypes and enzyme kinetic constants was also studied, leading to recommendations on which combinations might minimize off-flavor levels and what further work might be carried out to substantiate these conclusions.",

To understand why this motif is so prevalent, we examined its properties in an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory network in yeast (Oaf1p\/Pip2p). We demonstrate that the asymmetry in positive feedback confers a competitive advantage and allows the system to robustly increase its responsiveness while precisely tuning the response to a consistent level in the presence of varying stimuli. This study reveals evolutionary advantages for the ASSURE motif, and mechanisms for control, that are relevant to pharmacologic intervention and synthetic biology applications.",

It represents a unique strategy of antibiotic tolerance and it can complicate design of effective antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we have analyzed responses of a lab strain of Escherichia coli to antibiotics that target the ribosome. We show that the IE can be explained by bistable inhibition of bacterial growth. A critical requirement for this bistability is sufficiently fast degradation of ribosomes, which can result from antibiotic-induced heat-shock response. Furthermore, antibiotics that elicit the IE can lead to 'band-pass' response of bacterial growth to periodic antibiotic treatment: the treatment efficacy drastically diminishes at intermediate frequencies of treatment. Our proposed mechanism for the IE may be generally applicable to other bacterial species treated with antibiotics targeting the ribosomes.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Feedback loops, both positive and negative are embedded in the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascade. In the three layer MAPK cascade, both feedback loops originate from the terminal layer and their sites of action are either of the two upstream layers. Recent studies have shown that the cascade uses coupled positive and negative feedback loops in generating oscillations. Two plausible designs of coupled positive and negative feedback loops can be elucidated from the literature; in one design the positive feedback precedes the negative feedback in the direction of signal flow and vice-versa in another. But it remains unexplored how the two designs contribute towards triggering oscillations in MAPK cascade. Thus it is also not known how amplitude, frequency, robustness or nature (analogous\/digital) of the oscillations would be shaped by these two designs. RESULTS: We built two models of MAPK cascade that exhibited oscillations as function of two underlying designs of coupled positive and negative feedback loops. Frequency, amplitude and nature (digital\/analogous) of oscillations were found to be differentially determined by each design. It was observed that the positive feedback emerging from an oscillating MAPK cascade and functional in an external signal processing module can trigger oscillations in the target module, provided that the target module satisfy certain parametric requirements. The augmentation of the two models was done to incorporate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cascade components followed by induction of a nuclear phosphatase. It revealed that the fate of oscillations in the MAPK cascade is governed by the feedback designs. Oscillations were unaffected due to nuclear compartmentalization owing to one design but were completely abolished in the other case. CONCLUSION: The MAPK cascade can utilize two distinct designs of coupled positive and negative feedback loops to trigger oscillations. The amplitude, frequency and robustness of the oscillations in presence or absence of nuclear compartmentalization were differentially determined by two designs of coupled positive and negative feedback loops. A positive feedback from an oscillating MAPK cascade was shown to induce oscillations in an external signal processing module, uncovering a novel regulatory aspect of MAPK signal processing.",

        "abstract":"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a major signalling cascade acting in the quality control of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The cascade is known to play an accessory role in a range of genetic and environmental disorders including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and kidney diseases. The three major receptors of the ER stress involved with the UPR, i.e. IRE1 \u03b1, PERK and ATF6, signal through a complex web of pathways to convey an appropriate response. The emerging behaviour ranges from adaptive to maladaptive depending on the severity of unfolded protein accumulation in the ER; however, the decision mechanism for the switch and its timing have so far been poorly understood.Here, we propose a mechanism by which the UPR outcome switches between survival and death. We compose a mathematical model integrating the three signalling branches, and perform a comprehensive bifurcation analysis to investigate possible responses to stimuli. The analysis reveals three distinct states of behaviour, low, high and intermediate activity, associated with stress adaptation, tolerance, and the initiation of apoptosis. The decision to adapt or destruct can, therefore, be understood as a dynamic process where the balance between the stress and the folding capacity of the ER plays a pivotal role in managing the delivery of the most appropriate response. The model demonstrates for the first time that the UPR is capable of generating oscillations in translation attenuation and the apoptotic signals, and this is supplemented with a Bayesian sensitivity analysis identifying a set of parameters controlling this behaviour.This work contributes largely to the understanding of one of the most ubiquitous signalling pathways involved in protein folding quality control in the metazoan ER. The insights gained have direct consequences on the management of many UPR-related diseases, revealing, in addition, an extended list of candidate disease modifiers. Demonstration of stress adaptation sheds light to how preconditioning might be beneficial in manifesting the UPR outcome to prevent untimely apoptosis, and paves the way to novel approaches for the treatment of many UPR-related conditions.",

Extracellular activation of TGF-\u03b21 from its latent form provides spatiotemporal control over TGF-\u03b21 signaling, but the current understanding of TGF-\u03b21 activation does not emphasize cross talk between activators. Plasmin (PLS) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) have been studied individually as activators of TGF-\u03b21, and in this work we used a systems-level approach with mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments to study the interplay between PLS and TSP1 in TGF-\u03b21 activation. Simulations and steady-state analysis predicted a switch-like bistable transition between two levels of active TGF-\u03b21, with an inverse correlation between PLS and TSP1. In particular, the model predicted that increasing PLS breaks a TSP1-TGF-\u03b21 positive feedback loop and causes an unexpected net decrease in TGF-\u03b21 activation. To test these predictions in vitro, we treated rat hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells with PLS, which caused proteolytic cleavage of TSP1 and decreased activation of TGF-\u03b21. The TGF-\u03b21 activation levels showed a cooperative dose response, and a test of hysteresis in the cocultured cells validated that TGF-\u03b21 activation is bistable. We conclude that switch-like behavior arises from natural competition between two distinct modes of TGF-\u03b21 activation: a TSP1-mediated mode of high activation and a PLS-mediated mode of low activation. This switch suggests an explanation for the unexpected effects of the plasminogen activation system on TGF-\u03b21 in fibrotic diseases in vivo, as well as novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches for diseases with TGF-\u03b2 dysregulation.",

Insulin resistance reflects impairments in insulin signaling, but mechanisms involved are unclear because current research is fragmented. We report a systems level mechanistic understanding of insulin resistance, using systems wide and internally consistent data from human adipocytes. Based on quantitative steady-state and dynamic time course data on signaling intermediaries, normally and in diabetes, we developed a dynamic mathematical model of insulin signaling. The model structure and parameters are identical in the normal and diabetic states of the model, except for three parameters that change in diabetes: (i) reduced concentration of insulin receptor, (ii) reduced concentration of insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4, and (iii) changed feedback from mammalian target of rapamycin in complex with raptor (mTORC1). Modeling reveals that at the core of insulin resistance in human adipocytes is attenuation of a positive feedback from mTORC1 to the insulin receptor substrate-1, which explains reduced sensitivity and signal strength throughout the signaling network. Model simulations with inhibition of mTORC1 are comparable with experimental data on inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin in human adipocytes. We demonstrate the potential of the model for identification of drug targets, e.g. increasing the feedback restores insulin signaling, both at the cellular level and, using a multilevel model, at the whole body level.

In exponentially growing cells, polypeptide elongation (eEF1A, eEF2, and eEF3) exerts the strongest control. The two other strong control points are recruitment of mRNA and tRNA(i) to the 40S ribosomal subunit (eIF4F and eIF2) and termination (eRF1; Dbp5). In contrast, factors that are found to promote mRNA scanning efficiency on a longer than-average 5'untranslated region (eIF1, eIF1A, Ded1, eIF2B, eIF3, and eIF5) exceed the levels required for maximal control. This is expected to allow the cell to minimize scanning transition times, particularly for longer 5'UTRs.

To better understand the general stress response, we need to explore the mechanism by which the components interact. Here, we performed experiments in B. subtilis wild type and mutant strains to test and validate a mathematical model of the dynamics of \u03c3(B) activity. In the mutant strain BSA115, \u03c3(B) transcription is inducible by the addition of IPTG and negative control of \u03c3(B) activity by the anti-sigma factor RsbW is absent. In contrast to our expectations of a continuous \u03b2-galactosidase activity from a ctc::lacZ fusion, we observed a transient activity in the mutant. To explain this experimental finding, we constructed mathematical models reflecting different hypotheses regarding the regulation of \u03c3(B) and \u03b2-galactosidase dynamics.

To better understand the general stress response, we need to explore the mechanism by which the components interact. Here, we performed experiments in B. subtilis wild type and mutant strains to test and validate a mathematical model of the dynamics of \u03c3(B) activity. In the mutant strain BSA115, \u03c3(B) transcription is inducible by the addition of IPTG and negative control of \u03c3(B) activity by the anti-sigma factor RsbW is absent. In contrast to our expectations of a continuous \u03b2-galactosidase activity from a ctc::lacZ fusion, we observed a transient activity in the mutant. To explain this experimental finding, we constructed mathematical models reflecting different hypotheses regarding the regulation of \u03c3(B) and \u03b2-galactosidase dynamics.

        "abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disorder affecting humans, with advanced age being the most prominent risk factor for developing AD. Despite intense research efforts aimed at elucidating the precise molecular underpinnings of AD, a definitive answer is still lacking. In recent years, consensus has grown that dimerisation of the polypeptide amyloid-beta (A\u00df), particularly A\u00df\u2084\u2082, plays a crucial role in the neuropathology that characterise AD-affected post-mortem brains, including the large-scale accumulation of fibrils, also referred to as senile plaques. This has led to the realistic hope that targeting A\u00df\u2084\u2082 immunotherapeutically could drastically reduce plaque burden in the ageing brain, thus delaying AD onset or symptom progression. Stochastic modelling is a useful tool for increasing understanding of the processes underlying complex systems-affecting disorders such as AD, providing a rapid and inexpensive strategy for testing putative new therapies. In light of the tool's utility, we developed computer simulation models to examine A\u00df\u2084\u2082 turnover and its aggregation in detail and to test the effect of immunization against A\u00df dimers.Our model demonstrates for the first time that even a slight decrease in the clearance rate of A\u00df\u2084\u2082 monomers is sufficient to increase the chance of dimers forming, which could act as instigators of protofibril and fibril formation, resulting in increased plaque levels. As the process is slow and levels of A\u03b2 are normally low, stochastic effects are important. Our model predicts that reducing the rate of dimerisation leads to a significant reduction in plaque levels and delays onset of plaque formation. The model was used to test the effect of an antibody mediated immunological response. Our results showed that plaque levels were reduced compared to conditions where antibodies are not present.Our model supports the current thinking that levels of dimers are important in initiating the aggregation process. Although substantial knowledge exists regarding the process, no therapeutic intervention is on offer that reliably decreases disease burden in AD patients. Computer modelling could serve as one of a number of tools to examine both the validity of reliable biomarkers and aid the discovery of successful intervention strategies.",

The authors describe here a numerically continuous function suitable for use in SBML for models of circadian rhythms forced by periodic light-dark cycles. The Input Signal Step Function (ISSF) is broadly applicable to encoding experimental manipulations, such as drug treatments, temperature changes, or inducible transgene expression, which may be transient, periodic, or mixed. It is highly configurable and is able to reproduce a wide range of waveforms. The authors have implemented this function in SBML and demonstrated its ability to modify the behavior of publicly available models to accurately reproduce published results. The implementation of ISSF allows standard simulation software to reproduce specialized circadian protocols, such as the phase-response curve. To facilitate the reuse of this function in public models, the authors have developed software to configure its behavior without any specialist knowledge of SBML.

To address this issue, we experimentally measured metabolites in glucose metabolism in response to insulin. Step stimulation of insulin induced transient response of glycolysis and glycogenesis, and sustained response of gluconeogenesis and extracellular glucose concentration (GLC(ex)). Based on the experimental results, we constructed a simple computational model that characterises response of insulin-signalling-dependent glucose metabolism. The model revealed that the network motifs of glycolysis and glycogenesis pathways constitute a feedforward (FF) with substrate depletion and incoherent feedforward loop (iFFL), respectively, enabling glycolysis and glycogenesis responsive to temporal changes of insulin rather than its absolute concentration. In contrast, the network motifs of gluconeogenesis pathway constituted a FF inhibition, enabling gluconeogenesis responsive to absolute concentration of insulin regardless of its temporal patterns.

        "abstract":"Progress in the development of therapeutic interventions to treat or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease has been hampered by lack of efficacy and unforeseen side effects in human clinical trials. This setback highlights the need for new approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions. Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases. However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling approaches in many areas of biomedical research. We previously developed a stochastic computer model to examine some of the key pathways involved in the aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and the micro-tubular binding protein tau. Here we show how we extended this model to include the main processes involved in passive and active immunisation against A\u03b2 and then demonstrate the effects of this intervention on soluble A\u03b2, plaques, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The model predicts that immunisation leads to clearance of plaques but only results in small reductions in levels of soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The behaviour of this model is supported by neuropathological observations in Alzheimer patients immunised against A\u03b2. Since, soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles more closely correlate with cognitive decline than plaques, our model suggests that immunotherapy against A\u03b2 may not be effective unless it is performed very early in the disease process or combined with other therapies.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Plasmodium is the causal parasite of malaria, infectious disease responsible for the death of up to one million people each year. Glycerophospholipid and consequently membrane biosynthesis are essential for the survival of the parasite and are targeted by a new class of antimalarial drugs developed in our lab. In order to understand the highly redundant phospholipid synthethic pathways and eventual mechanism of resistance to various drugs, an organism specific kinetic model of these metabolic pathways need to be developed in Plasmodium species. RESULTS: Fluxomic data were used to build a quantitative kinetic model of glycerophospholipid pathways in Plasmodium knowlesi. In vitro incorporation dynamics of phospholipids unravels multiple synthetic pathways. A detailed metabolic network with values of the kinetic parameters (maximum rates and Michaelis constants) has been built. In order to obtain a global search in the parameter space, we have designed a hybrid, discrete and continuous, optimization method. Discrete parameters were used to sample the cone of admissible fluxes, whereas the continuous Michaelis and maximum rates constants were obtained by local minimization of an objective function.The model was used to predict the distribution of fluxes within the network of various metabolic precursors.The quantitative analysis was used to understand eventual links between different pathways. The major source of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the CDP-choline Kennedy pathway.In silico knock-out experiments showed comparable importance of phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PMT) and phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) for PC synthesis.The flux values indicate that, major part of serine derived phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is formed via serine decarboxylation, whereas major part of phosphatidylserine (PS) is formed by base-exchange reactions.Sensitivity analysis of CDP-choline pathway shows that the carrier-mediated choline entry into the parasite and the phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase reaction have the largest sensitivity coefficients in this pathway, but does not distinguish a reaction as an unique rate-limiting step. CONCLUSION: We provide a fully parametrized kinetic model for the multiple phospholipid synthetic pathways in P. knowlesi. This model has been used to clarify the relative importance of the various reactions in these metabolic pathways. Future work extensions of this modelling strategy will serve to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing the development of Plasmodium during its blood stages, as well as the mechanisms of action of drugs on membrane biosynthetic pathways and eventual mechanisms of resistance.",

        "abstract":"Objective. To use a novel computational approach to examine the molecular pathways involved in cartilage breakdown and to use computer simulation to test possible interventions to reduce collagen release. Methods. We constructed a computational model of the relevant molecular pathways using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a computer-readable format of a biochemical network. The model was constructed using our experimental data showing that interleukin-1 (IL-1) and oncostatin M (OSM) act synergistically to up-regulate collagenase protein and activity and initiate cartilage collagen breakdown. Simulations were performed in the COPASI software package. Results. The model predicted that simulated inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and over-expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP-3) led to a reduction in collagen release. Over-expression of TIMP-1 was much less effective than TIMP-3 and led to a delay, rather than a reduction, in collagen release. Simulated interventions of receptor antagonists and inhibition of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), the first kinase in the OSM pathway, were ineffective. So, importantly, the model predicts that it is more effective to intervene at targets which are downstream, such as the JNK pathway, rather than close to the cytokine signal. In vitro experiments confirmed the effectiveness of JNK inhibition. Conclusion. Our study shows the value of computer modelling as a tool for examining possible interventions to reduce cartilage collagen breakdown. The model predicts interventions that either prevent transcription or inhibit activity of collagenases are promising strategies and should be investigated further in an experimental setting. \u00a9 2013 American College of Rheumatology.",

To obtain insight into the network dynamics of fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation, we constructed a detailed computational model of the pathway and subjected it to a fat overload condition. The model contains reversible and saturable enzyme-kinetic equations and experimentally determined parameters for rat-liver enzymes. It was validated by adding palmitoyl CoA or palmitoyl carnitine to isolated rat-liver mitochondria: without refitting of measured parameters, the model correctly predicted the \u03b2-oxidation flux as well as the time profiles of most acyl-carnitine concentrations. Subsequently, we simulated the condition of obesity by increasing the palmitoyl-CoA concentration. At a high concentration of palmitoyl CoA the \u03b2-oxidation became overloaded: the flux dropped and metabolites accumulated. This behavior originated from the competition between acyl CoAs of different chain lengths for a set of acyl-CoA dehydrogenases with overlapping substrate specificity. This effectively induced competitive feedforward inhibition and thereby led to accumulation of CoA-ester intermediates and depletion of free CoA (CoASH). The mitochondrial [NAD\u207a]\/[NADH] ratio modulated the sensitivity to substrate overload, revealing a tight interplay between regulation of \u03b2-oxidation and mitochondrial respiration.",

        "abstract":"Most neocortical neurons formed during embryonic brain development arise from radial glial cells which communicate, in part, via ATP mediated calcium signals. Although the intercellular signalling mechanisms that regulate radial glia proliferation are not well understood, it has recently been demonstrated that ATP dependent intracellular calcium release leads to an increase of nearly 100% in overall cellular proliferation. It has been hypothesised that cytoplasmic calcium accelerates entry into S phase of the cell cycle and\/or acts to recruit otherwise quiescent cells onto the cell cycle. In this paper we study this cell cycle acceleration and recruitment by forming a differential equation model for ATP mediated calcium-cell cycle coupling via Cyclin D in a single radial glial cell. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations suggest that the cell cycle period depends only weakly on cytoplasmic calcium. Therefore, the accelerative impact of calcium on the cell cycle can only account for a small fraction of the large increase in proliferation observed experimentally. Crucially however, our bifurcation analysis reveals that stable fixed point and stable limit cycle solutions can coexist, and that calcium dependent Cyclin D dynamics extend the oscillatory region to lower Cyclin D synthesis rates, thus rendering cells more susceptible to cycling. This supports the hypothesis that cycling glial cells recruit quiescent cells (in G0 phase) onto the cell cycle, via a calcium signalling mechanism, and that this may be the primary means by which calcium augments proliferation rates at the population scale. Numerical simulations of two coupled cells demonstrate that such a scenario is indeed feasible.",

        "abstract":"PURPOSE: To develop a tumor growth inhibition model for adult diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using longitudinal mean tumor diameter (MTD) data from 21 patients treated with first-line procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy, we formulated a model consisting of a system of differential equations, incorporating tumor-specific and treatment-related parameters that reflect the response of proliferative and quiescent tumor tissue to treatment. The model was then applied to the analysis of longitudinal tumor size data in 24 patients treated with first-line temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and in 25 patients treated with first-line radiotherapy. RESULTS: The model successfully described the MTD dynamics of LGG before, during, and after PCV chemotherapy. Using the same model structure, we were also able to successfully describe the MTD dynamics in LGG patients treated with TMZ chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor-specific parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment modalities. The model is robust to sensitivity analysis, and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of pretreatment tumor size data. CONCLUSIONS: Using MTD data, we propose a tumor growth inhibition model able to describe LGG tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the future, this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in LGG patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy schedules.",

        "abstract":"As multicellular organisms grow, positional information is continually needed to regulate the pattern in which cells are arranged. In the Arabidopsis root, most cell types are organized in a radially symmetric pattern; however, a symmetry-breaking event generates bisymmetric auxin and cytokinin signaling domains in the stele. Bidirectional cross-talk between the stele and the surrounding tissues involving a mobile transcription factor, SHORT ROOT (SHR), and mobile microRNA species also determines vascular pattern, but it is currently unclear how these signals integrate. We use a multicellular model to determine a minimal set of components necessary for maintaining a stable vascular pattern. Simulations perturbing the signaling network show that, in addition to the mutually inhibitory interaction between auxin and cytokinin, signaling through SHR, microRNA165\/6, and PHABULOSA is required to maintain a stable bisymmetric pattern. We have verified this prediction by observing loss of bisymmetry in shr mutants. The model reveals the importance of several features of the network, namely the mutual degradation of microRNA165\/6 and PHABULOSA and the existence of an additional negative regulator of cytokinin signaling. These components form a plausible mechanism capable of patterning vascular tissues in the absence of positional inputs provided by the transport of hormones from the shoot.",

Modeling indicated that sustained membrane-bound caspase-8 activity is followed by transient cytosolic activity, which can be interpreted as a molecular timer mechanism reflected by a limited lifetime of active caspase-8. The activation of caspase-8 by combined intra- and interdimeric cleavage ensures weak signaling at low concentrations of CD95L and strongly accelerated activation at higher ligand concentrations, thereby contributing to precise control of apoptosis.",

We have studied the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin in an animal model for complicated Salmonellosis. High-dose ciprofloxacin treatment efficiently reduced pathogen loads in feces and most organs. However, the cecum draining lymph node (cLN), the gut tissue, and the spleen retained surviving bacteria. In cLN, approximately 10%-20% of the bacteria remained viable. These phenotypically tolerant bacteria lodged mostly within CD103\u207aCX\u2083CR1\u207bCD11c\u207a dendritic cells, remained genetically susceptible to ciprofloxacin, were sufficient to reinitiate infection after the end of the therapy, and displayed an extremely slow growth rate, as shown by mathematical analysis of infections with mixed inocula and segregative plasmid experiments. The slow growth was sufficient to explain recalcitrance to antibiotics treatment. Therefore, slow-growing antibiotic-tolerant bacteria lodged within dendritic cells can explain poor in vivo antibiotic activity and relapse. Administration of LPS or CpG, known elicitors of innate immune defense, reduced the loads of tolerant bacteria. Thus, manipulating innate immunity may augment the in vivo activity of antibiotics.",

Recently, it has been shown that pairs of miRNAs can repress the translation of a target mRNA in a cooperative manner, which leads to an enhanced effectiveness and specificity in target repression. However, it remains unclear which miRNA pairs can synergize and which genes are target of cooperative miRNA regulation. In this paper, we present a computational workflow for the prediction and analysis of cooperating miRNAs and their mutual target genes, which we refer to as RNA triplexes. The workflow integrates methods of miRNA target prediction; triplex structure analysis; molecular dynamics simulations and mathematical modeling for a reliable prediction of functional RNA triplexes and target repression efficiency. In a case study we analyzed the human genome and identified several thousand targets of cooperative gene regulation. Our results suggest that miRNA cooperativity is a frequent mechanism for an enhanced target repression by pairs of miRNAs facilitating distinctive and fine-tuned target gene expression patterns.

Kinetic models that include reaction pathways and rate parameters for the various stages of the process can be helpful towards understanding the dynamics on a molecular level.

The model and the rate parameters include different molecular structural stages in the nucleation and polymerization processes and the numerical solutions yield graphs of concentrations of different molecular species versus time that are in close agreement with experimental results. The model also allows for the calculation of the time-dependent increase in aggregate size. The calculated results agree well with experimental results, and allow differences in experimental conditions to be included in the calculations. The specific steps of the model and the rate constants that are determined by fitting to experimental data provide insight on the molecular species involved in the fibril formation process.",

We used a systems biology approach to study tau aggregation, one of the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease. A mathematical model was constructed to capture the current state of knowledge concerning tau's behavior and interactions in cells. The model was implemented in silico in the form of ordinary differential equations. The identifiability of the model was assessed and parameters were estimated to generate two cellular states: a population of solutions that corresponds to normal tau homeostasis and a population of solutions that displays aggregation-prone behavior. The model of normal tau homeostasis was robust to perturbations, and disturbances in multiple processes were required to achieve an aggregation-prone state. The aggregation-prone state was ultrasensitive to perturbations in diverse subsets of networks. Tau aggregation requires that multiple cellular parameters are set coordinately to a set of values that drive pathological assembly of tau. This model provides a foundation on which to build and increase our understanding of the series of events that lead to tau aggregation and may ultimately be used to identify critical intervention points that can direct the cell away from tau aggregation to aid in the treatment of tau-mediated (or related) aggregation diseases including Alzheimer's.",

However, we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune response kinetics to IAV infection and which biological parameters most strongly influence infection outcomes. To address these issues, we use modeling approaches combined with experimental data to quantitatively investigate the innate and adaptive immune responses to primary IAV infection. Mathematical models were developed to describe the dynamic interactions between target (epithelial) cells, influenza virus, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and virus-specific IgG and IgM. IAV and immune kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting models to a large data set obtained from primary H3N2 IAV infection of 340 mice. Prior to a detectable virus-specific immune response (before day 5), the estimated half-life of infected epithelial cells is approximately 1.2 days, and the half-life of free infectious IAV is approximately 4 h. During the adaptive immune response (after day 5), the average half-life of infected epithelial cells is approximately 0.5 days, and the average half-life of free infectious virus is approximately 1.8 min. During the adaptive phase, model fitting confirms that CD8(+) CTLs are crucial for limiting infected cells, while virus-specific IgM regulates free IAV levels. This may imply that CD4 T cells and class-switched IgG antibodies are more relevant for generating IAV-specific memory and preventing future infection via a more rapid secondary immune response. Also, simulation studies were performed to understand the relative contributions of biological parameters to IAV clearance. This study provides a basis to better understand and predict influenza virus immunity.",

In the presence of excess proteasomes the cell easily maintains homeostasis. However, when the ratio between the available proteasome and the alphaSN protofilaments is reduced below a threshold level, we predict a collapse of homeostasis and onset of oscillations in the proteasome concentration. Depleted proteasome opens for accumulation of oligomers. Our analysis suggests that the onset of PD is associated with a proteasome population that becomes occupied in periodic degradation of aggregates. This behavior is found to be the general state of a proteasome\/chaperone system under pressure, and suggests new interpretations of other diseases where protein aggregation could stress elements of the protein quality control system.",

A\u03b2 is produced via multiple proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mediated by the enzymes \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase. In this study, we examine the temporal dynamics of soluble (unaggregated) A\u03b2 in the plasma and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) of rhesus monkeys treated with different oral doses of a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor. A dose-dependent reduction of A\u03b2 concentration was observed within hours of drug ingestion, for all doses tested. A\u03b2 concentration in the CSF returned to its predrug level over the monitoring period. In contrast, A\u03b2 concentration in the plasma exhibited an unexpected overshoot to as high as 200% of the predrug concentration, and this overshoot persisted as late as 72 hours post-drug ingestion. To account for these observations, we proposed and analyzed a minimal physiological model for A\u03b2 dynamics that could fit the data. Our analysis suggests that the overshoot arises from the attenuation of an A\u03b2 clearance mechanism, possibly due to the inhibitor. Our model predicts that the efficacy of A\u03b2 clearance recovers to its basal (pretreatment) value with a characteristic time of >48 hours, matching the time-scale of the overshoot. These results point to the need for a more detailed investigation of soluble A\u03b2 clearance mechanisms and their interaction with A\u03b2-reducing drugs.",

We describe each mechanism with a differential equation, and then solve the two equations numerically.

According to the hypothesis, an increase in beta-amyloid concentration caused by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein results in an increase in the leakage of choline out of cells. This leads to a reduction in intracellular choline concentration and hence a reduction in acetylcholine production. The reduction in acetylcholine production, in turn, causes an increase in the concentration of beta-amyloid. The resultant positive feedback between decreased acetylcholine and increased beta-amyloid accelerates the loss of acetylcholine. We compare the predictions of the choline-leakage hypothesis with a number of experimental observations. We also approximate it with a pair of ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations indicate that the loss of acetylcholine is very sensitive to the initial rate of beta-amyloid production.",

        "abstract":"Previous article on the integrative modelling of Parkinson's disease (PD) described a mathematical model with properties suggesting that PD pathogenesis is associated with a feedback-induced biochemical bistability. In this article, the authors show that the dynamics of the mathematical model can be extracted and distilled into an equivalent two-state feedback motif whose stability properties are controlled by multi-factorial combinations of risk factors and genetic mutations associated with PD. Based on this finding, the authors propose a principle for PD pathogenesis in the form of the switch-like transition of a bistable feedback process from 'healthy' homeostatic levels of reactive oxygen species and the protein \u03b1-synuclein, to an alternative 'disease' state in which concentrations of both molecules are stable at the damagingly high-levels associated with PD. The bistability is analysed using the rate curves and steady-state response characteristics of the feedback motif. In particular, the authors show how a bifurcation in the feedback motif marks the pathogenic moment at which the 'healthy' state is lost and the 'disease' state is initiated. Further analysis shows how known risks (such as: age, toxins and genetic predisposition) modify the stability characteristics of the feedback motif in a way that is compatible with known features of PD, and which explain properties such as: multi-factorial causality, variability in susceptibility and severity, multi-timescale progression and the special cases of familial Parkinson's and Parkinsonian symptoms induced purely by toxic stress.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is central in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Converging pieces of evidence suggest that the levels of ASYN expression play a critical role in both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. ASYN fibrils are the main component of inclusions called Lewy Bodies (LBs) which are found mainly in the surviving neurons of the substantia nigra. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the involvement of ASYN in molecular mechanisms underlying the development of PD, there is much information missing which prevents understanding the causes of the disease and how to stop its progression. RESULTS: Using a Systems Biology approach, we develop a biomolecular reactions model that describes the intracellular ASYN dynamics in relation to overexpression, post-translational modification, oligomerization and degradation of the protein. Especially for the proteolysis of ASYN, the model takes into account the biological knowledge regarding the contribution of Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA), macro-autophagic and proteasome pathways in the protein's degradation. Importantly, inhibitory phenomena, caused by ASYN, concerning CMA (more specifically the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2a, abbreviated as Lamp2a receptor, which is the rate limiting step of CMA) and the proteasome are carefully modeled. The model is validated by simulation studies of known experimental overexpression data from SH-SY5Y cells and the unknown model parameters are estimated either computationally or by experimental fitting. The calibrated model is then tested under three hypothetical intervention scenarios and in all cases predicts increased cell viability that agrees with experimental evidence. The biomodel has been annotated and is made available in SBML format. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model presented here successfully simulates the dynamic phenomena of ASYN overexpression and oligomerization and predicts the biological system's behavior in a number of scenarios not used for model calibration. It allows, for the first time, to qualitatively estimate the protein levels that are capable of deregulating proteolytic homeostasis. In addition, it can help form new hypotheses for intervention that could be tested experimentally.",

Sections were stained with H&E, Safranin-O, Picro-sirius red and antibodies to matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), nitrotyrosine, LC-3B, Bcl-2, and cleaved type II collagen used for immunohistochemistry. Based on this and other data from the literature, a computer simulation model was built using the Systems Biology Markup Language using an iterative approach of data analysis and modelling. Individual parameters were subsequently altered to assess their effect on the model.A progressive loss of cartilage matrix occurred with age. Nitrotyrosine, MMP-13 and activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK1) staining in cartilage increased with age with a concomitant decrease in LC-3B and Bcl-2. Stochastic simulations from the computational model showed a good agreement with these data, once transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signalling via ALK1\/ALK5 receptors was included. Oxidative stress and the interleukin 1 pathway were identified as key factors in driving the cartilage breakdown associated with ageing.A progressive loss of cartilage matrix and cellularity occurs with age. This is accompanied with increased levels of oxidative stress, apoptosis and MMP-13 and a decrease in chondrocyte autophagy. These changes explain the marked predisposition of joints to develop osteoarthritis with age. Computational modelling provides useful insights into the underlying mechanisms involved in age-related changes in musculoskeletal tissues.",

Several clock genes have been implicated in the temperature-dependent control of period in Arabidopsis. We show that blue light is essential for this, suggesting that the effects of light and temperature interact or converge upon common targets in the circadian clock. Our data demonstrate that two cryptochrome photoreceptors differentially control circadian period and sustain rhythmicity across the physiological temperature range. In order to test the hypothesis that the targets of light regulation are sufficient to mediate temperature compensation, we constructed a temperature-compensated clock model by adding passive temperature effects into only the light-sensitive processes in the model. Remarkably, this model was not only capable of full temperature compensation and consistent with mRNA profiles across a temperature range, but also predicted the temperature-dependent change in the level of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, a key clock protein.

We showed that numerous G1\/S transition components are activated upon hepatocyte isolation whereas DNA replication only occurs upon additional HGF stimulation. In response to HGF, Cyclin:CDK complex formation was increased, p21 rather than p27 was regulated, and Rb expression was enhanced. Quantification of protein levels at the restriction point showed an excess of CDK2 over CDK4 and limiting amounts of the transcription factor E2F-1. Analysis with our mathematical model revealed that T160 phosphorylation of CDK2 correlated best with growth factor-dependent proliferation, which we validated experimentally on both the population and the single cell level.

Although several kinetic models of Lactococcus lactis (a Lactic Acid Bacterium (LAB) commonly used in the dairy industry) have been developed so far, most of them are simplified and focus only on specific metabolic pathways. Therefore, the application of mathematical models in the design of an engineering strategy for the production of industrially important products by L. lactis has been very limited. In this work, we extend the existing kinetic model of L. lactis central metabolism to include industrially relevant production pathways such as mannitol and 2,3-butanediol. In this way, we expect to study the dynamics of metabolite production and make predictive simulations in L. lactis. We used a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with approximate Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics for each reaction, where the parameters were estimated from multivariate time-series metabolite concentrations obtained by our team through in vivo Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The results show that the model captures observed transient dynamics when validated under a wide range of experimental conditions. Furthermore, we analyzed the model using global perturbations, which corroborate experimental evidence about metabolic responses upon enzymatic changes. These include that mannitol production is very sensitive to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the wild type (W.T.) strain, and to mannitol phosphoenolpyruvate: a phosphotransferase system (PTS(Mtl)) in a LDH mutant strain. LDH reduction has also a positive control on 2,3-butanediol levels. Furthermore, it was found that overproduction of mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (MPD) in a LDH\/PTS(Mtl) deficient strain can increase the mannitol levels. The results show that this model has prediction capability over new experimental conditions and offers promising possibilities to elucidate the effect of alterations in the main metabolism of L. lactis, with application in strain optimization.",

The approach allows for the simulation of human disease through its ability to organize and integrate existing information about metabolic pathways without having a full quantitative description of those pathways, so that hypotheses about individual processes may be tested in a systems environment. Incorporating this method, the PD model describes alpha-synuclein aggregation as mediated by dopamine metabolism, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and lysosomal degradation, allowing for the examination of dynamic pathway interactions and the evaluation of possible toxic mechanisms in the aggregation process. Four system perturbations: elevated alpha-synuclein aggregation, impaired dopamine packaging, increased neurotoxins, and alpha-synuclein overexpression, were analyzed for correlation to qualitative PD system hypotheses present in the literature, with the model demonstrating a high level of agreement with these hypotheses. Additionally, various PD treatment methods, including levadopa and monoamine oxidase inhibition (MAOI) therapy, were applied to the disease models to examine their effects on the system. Future additions and refinements to the model may further the understanding of the emergent behaviors of the disease, helping in the identification of system sensitivities and possible therapeutic targets.",

We demonstrate that regulatory signals between these two nuclear receptors are necessary to optimize the body's response to stress episodes, attenuating both the magnitude and duration of the biological response. In addition, we predict that the activation of pregnane X-receptor by multiple, low-affinity endobiotic ligands is necessary for the significant pregnane X-receptor-mediated transcriptional response observed following stress episodes.

It has been hypothesized that the redox rhythm is linked to the circadian clock, but the mechanism and the biological significance of this link have only begun to be investigated. Here we report that the master immune regulator NPR1 (non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene 1) of Arabidopsis is a sensor of the plant's redox state and regulates transcription of core circadian clock genes even in the absence of pathogen challenge. Surprisingly, acute perturbation in the redox status triggered by the immune signal salicylic acid does not compromise the circadian clock but rather leads to its reinforcement. Mathematical modelling and subsequent experiments show that NPR1 reinforces the circadian clock without changing the period by regulating both the morning and the evening clock genes. This balanced network architecture helps plants gate their immune responses towards the morning and minimize costs on growth at night. Our study demonstrates how a sensitive redox rhythm interacts with a robust circadian clock to ensure proper responsiveness to environmental stimuli without compromising fitness of the organism.",

Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK) is activated by energy deprivation and shuts off adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-consuming anabolic processes, in part via the inactivation of mTORC1. Surprisingly, we observed that AMPK not only responds to energy deprivation but can also be activated by insulin, and is further induced in mTORC1-deficient cells. We have recently modelled the mTOR network, covering both mTOR complexes and their insulin and nutrient inputs. In the present study we extended the network by an AMPK module to generate the to date most comprehensive data-driven dynamic AMPK-mTOR network model. In order to define the intersection via which AMPK is activated by the insulin network, we compared simulations for six different hypothetical model structures to our observed AMPK dynamics. Hypotheses ranking suggested that the most probable intersection between insulin and AMPK was the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and that the effects of canonical IRS downstream cues on AMPK would be mediated via an mTORC1-driven negative-feedback loop. We tested these predictions experimentally in multiple set-ups, where we inhibited or induced players along the insulin-mTORC1 signalling axis and observed AMPK induction or inhibition. We confirmed the identified model and therefore report a novel connection within the insulin-mTOR-AMPK network: we conclude that AMPK is positively regulated by IRS and can be inhibited via the negative-feedback loop.",

        "abstract":"The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) exists in two multiprotein complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and is a central regulator of growth and metabolism. Insulin activation of mTORC1, mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and the inhibitory tuberous sclerosis complex 1\/2 (TSC1-TSC2), initiates a negative feedback loop that ultimately inhibits PI3K. We present a data-driven dynamic insulin-mTOR network model that integrates the entire core network and used this model to investigate the less well understood mechanisms by which insulin regulates mTORC2. By analyzing the effects of perturbations targeting several levels within the network in silico and experimentally, we found that, in contrast to current hypotheses, the TSC1-TSC2 complex was not a direct or indirect (acting through the negative feedback loop) regulator of mTORC2. Although mTORC2 activation required active PI3K, this was not affected by the negative feedback loop. Therefore, we propose an mTORC2 activation pathway through a PI3K variant that is insensitive to the negative feedback loop that regulates mTORC1. This putative pathway predicts that mTORC2 would be refractory to Akt, which inhibits TSC1-TSC2, and, indeed, we found that mTORC2 was insensitive to constitutive Akt activation in several cell types. Our results suggest that a previously unknown network structure connects mTORC2 to its upstream cues and clarifies which molecular connectors contribute to mTORC2 activation.",

The changes which occur in senescence are controlled by networks of multiple signalling and feedback pathways at the cellular level, and the interplay between these is difficult to predict and understand. To unravel the intrinsic challenges of understanding such a highly networked system, we have taken a systems biology approach to cellular senescence. We report a detailed analysis of senescence signalling via DNA damage, insulin-TOR, FoxO3a transcription factors, oxidative stress response, mitochondrial regulation and mitophagy. We show in silico and in vitro that inhibition of reactive oxygen species can prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, whilst inhibition of mTOR shows a partial rescue of mitochondrial mass changes during establishment of senescence. Dual inhibition of ROS and mTOR in vitro confirmed computational model predictions that it was possible to further reduce senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA double-strand breaks. However, these interventions were unable to abrogate the senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction completely, and we identified decreased mitochondrial fission as the potential driving force for increased mitochondrial mass via prevention of mitophagy. Dynamic sensitivity analysis of the model showed the network stabilised at a new late state of cellular senescence. This was characterised by poor network sensitivity, high signalling noise, low cellular energy, high inflammation and permanent cell cycle arrest suggesting an unsatisfactory outcome for treatments aiming to delay or reverse cellular senescence at late time points. Combinatorial targeted interventions are therefore possible for intervening in the cellular pathway to senescence, but in the cases identified here, are only capable of delaying senescence onset.",

To better understand the dynamics of mucosal immunity during C. difficile infection from initiation through expansion to resolution, we built a computational model of the mucosal immune response to the bacterium. The model was calibrated using data from a mouse model of C. difficile infection. The model demonstrates a crucial role of T helper 17 (Th17) effector responses in the colonic lamina propria and luminal commensal bacteria populations in the clearance of C. difficile and colonic pathology, whereas regulatory T (Treg) cells responses are associated with the recovery phase. In addition, the production of anti-microbial peptides by inflamed epithelial cells and activated neutrophils in response to C. difficile infection inhibit the re-growth of beneficial commensal bacterial species. Computational simulations suggest that the removal of neutrophil and epithelial cell derived anti-microbial inhibitions, separately and together, on commensal bacterial regrowth promote recovery and minimize colonic inflammatory pathology. Simulation results predict a decrease in colonic inflammatory markers, such as neutrophilic influx and Th17 cells in the colonic lamina propria, and length of infection with accelerated commensal bacteria re-growth through altered anti-microbial inhibition. Computational modeling provides novel insights on the therapeutic value of repopulating the colonic microbiome and inducing regulatory mucosal immune responses during C. difficile infection.

However, selecting targets from this pathway either by intuition or by non-contextual measures is likely to be challenging. An alternative approach is to construct a mathematical model of the system and via sensitivity analysis rank order the targets in the known pathway, with respect to an endpoint such as the diphosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase concentration in the nucleus. Using the published literature, a model was created and, via sensitivity analysis, it was concluded that, after NGF itself, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) was one of the most sensitive druggable targets. This initial model was subsequently used to develop a further model incorporating physiological and pharmacological parameters. This allowed the exploration of the characteristics required for a successful hypothetical TrkA inhibitor. Using these systems models, we were able to identify candidates for the optimal drug targets in the known pathway. These conclusions were consistent with clinical and human genetic data. We also found that incorporating appropriate physiological context was essential to drawing accurate conclusions about important parameters such as the drug dose required to give pathway inhibition. Furthermore, the importance of the concentration of key reactants such as TrkA kinase means that appropriate contextual data are required before clear conclusions can be drawn. Such models could be of great utility in selecting optimal targets and in the clinical evaluation of novel drugs.",

However, the extent to which phosphorylated STAT5A and STAT5B (pSTAT5A, pSTAT5B) form homo- or heterodimers is not understood, nor is how this might influence the signal transmission to the nucleus. To study this, we designed a concept to investigate the isoform-specific dimerization behavior of pSTAT5A and pSTAT5B that comprises isoform-specific immunoprecipitation (IP), measurement of the degree of phosphorylation, and isoform ratio determination between STAT5A and STAT5B. For the main analytical method, we employed quantitative label-free and -based mass spectrometry. For the cellular model system, we used Epo receptor (EpoR)-expressing BaF3 cells (BaF3-EpoR) stimulated with Epo. Three hypotheses of dimer formation between pSTAT5A and pSTAT5B were used to explain the analytical results by a static mathematical model: formation of (i) homodimers only, (ii) heterodimers only, and (iii) random formation of homo- and heterodimers. The best agreement between experimental data and model simulations was found for the last case.

Here we use a simple modelling approach together with experiments to show that the establishment of the threshold requires both the multiplicity of binding sites and cooperative binding of Cbl and Grb2 to the EGFR. While the threshold is remarkably robust, a more sophisticated model predicted that it could be modulated as a function of EGFR levels on the cell surface. We confirmed experimentally that the system has evolved to perform optimally at physiological levels of EGFR.

Host responses toward the bacterium can result in asymptomatic, pathogenic or even favorable health outcomes; however, mechanisms underlying the dual role of H. pylori as a commensal versus pathogenic organism are not well characterized. Recent evidence suggests mononuclear phagocytes are largely involved in shaping dominant immunity during infection mediating the balance between host tolerance and succumbing to overt disease. We combined computational modeling, bioinformatics and experimental validation in order to investigate interactions between macrophages and intracellular H. pylori. Global transcriptomic analysis on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) in a gentamycin protection assay at six time points unveiled the presence of three sequential host response waves: an early transient regulatory gene module followed by sustained and late effector responses. Kinetic behaviors of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are linked to differential expression of spatiotemporal response waves and function to induce effector immunity through extracellular and intracellular detection of H. pylori. We report that bacterial interaction with the host intracellular environment caused significant suppression of regulatory NLRC3 and NLRX1 in a pattern inverse to early regulatory responses. To further delineate complex immune responses and pathway crosstalk between effector and regulatory PRRs, we built a computational model calibrated using time-series RNAseq data. Our validated computational hypotheses are that: 1) NLRX1 expression regulates bacterial burden in macrophages; and 2) early host response cytokines down-regulate NLRX1 expression through a negative feedback circuit. This paper applies modeling approaches to characterize the regulatory role of NLRX1 in mechanisms of host tolerance employed by macrophages to respond to and\/or to co-exist with intracellular H. pylori.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The family of TGF-\u03b2 ligands is large and its members are involved in many different signaling processes. These signaling processes strongly differ in type with TGF-\u03b2 ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members of the TGF-\u03b2 family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then be expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand concentration. A number of different models have been proposed to reconcile these different behaviours. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications that are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling network. RESULTS: To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the core of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we identified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give rise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as well as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to time-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens). A combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus biases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while oscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the turn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient receptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding. We find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the response type. The intensity of a constant signal (i.e. the ligand concentration), on the other hand, affected only the strength but not the type of the response. CONCLUSIONS: The architecture of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway enables the observed signaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGF-\u03b2 ligand in different cell types and under different conditions can be explained with differences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective rate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways. It will be interesting to uncover the exact cellular differences as well as the details of the cross-talks in future work.",

Phase 1 is characterized by a large increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) with a minimal reduction of the free luminal SR [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]FSR). Importantly, active SR Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA pumps) are necessary for phase 1 to occur. This situation cannot be explained by the standard kinetics that involves a fixed amount of luminal Ca2+ binding sites. A new mathematical model was developed that assumes an increasing SR Ca2+ buffering capacity in response to an increase of the luminal SR [Ca2+] that is called Kinetics-on-Demand (KonD) model. This approach can explain both phase 1 and the refractory period associated with a recovered [Ca2+]FSR. Additionally, our data suggest that active SERCA pumps are a requisite for KonD to be functional; otherwise luminal SR Ca2+ binding proteins switch to standard kinetics. The importance of KonD Ca2+ binding properties is twofold: a more efficient Ca2+ release process and that [Ca2+]FSR and Ca2+-bound to SR proteins ([Ca2+]BSR) can be regulated separately allowing for Ca2+ release to occur (provided by Ca2+-bound to luminal Ca2+ binding proteins) without an initial reduction of the [Ca2+]FSR.",

Current models of acetaminophen metabolism are complex, and limited to numerical investigation though provide results that represent clinical investigation well. We derive a mathematical model based on mass action laws aimed at capturing the main dynamics of acetaminophen metabolism, in particular the contrast between normal and overdose cases, whilst remaining simple enough for detailed mathematical analysis that can identify key parameters and quantify their role in liver toxicity. We use singular perturbation analysis to separate the different timescales describing the sequence of events in acetaminophen metabolism, systematically identifying which parameters dominate during each of the successive stages. Using this approach we determined, in terms of the model parameters, the critical dose between safe and overdose cases, timescales for exhaustion and regeneration of important cofactors for acetaminophen metabolism and total toxin accumulation as a fraction of initial dose.",

        "abstract":"Bone remodeling is the continuous process of bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts, in order to maintain homeostasis. The activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts is regulated by a network of signaling pathways, including Wnt, parathyroid hormone (PTH), RANK ligand\/osteoprotegrin, and TGF-\u03b2, in response to stimuli, such as mechanical loading. During aging there is a gradual loss of bone mass due to dysregulation of signaling pathways. This may be due to a decline in physical activity with age and\/or changes in hormones and other signaling molecules. In particular, hormones, such as PTH, have a circadian rhythm, which may be disrupted in aging. Due to the complexity of the molecular and cellular networks involved in bone remodeling, several mathematical models have been proposed to aid understanding of the processes involved. However, to date, there are no models, which explicitly consider the effects of mechanical loading, the circadian rhythm of PTH, and the dynamics of signaling molecules on bone remodeling. Therefore, we have constructed a network model of the system using a modular approach, which will allow further modifications as required in future research. The model was used to simulate the effects of mechanical loading and also the effects of different interventions, such as continuous or intermittent administration of PTH. Our model predicts that the absence of regular mechanical loading and\/or an impaired PTH circadian rhythm leads to a gradual decrease in bone mass over time, which can be restored by simulated interventions and that the effectiveness of some interventions may depend on their timing.",

        "abstract":"Conformational transitions of human calcitonin (hCT) during fibril formation in the acidic and neutral conditions were investigated by high-resolution solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy. In aqueous acetic acid solution (pH 3.3), a local alpha-helical form is present around Gly10 whereas a random coil form is dominant as viewed from Phe22, Ala26, and Ala31 in the monomer form on the basis of the 13C chemical shifts. On the other hand, a local beta-sheet form as viewed from Gly10 and Phe22, and both beta-sheet and random coil as viewed from Ala26 and Ala31 were detected in the fibril at pH 3.3. The results indicate that conformational transitions from alpha-helix to beta-sheet, and from random coil to beta-sheet forms occurred in the central and C-terminus regions, respectively, during the fibril formation. The increased 13C resonance intensities of fibrils after a certain delay time suggests that the fibrillation can be explained by a two-step reaction mechanism in which the first step is a homogeneous association to form a nucleus, and the second step is an autocatalytic heterogeneous fibrillation. In contrast to the fibril at pH 3.3, the fibril at pH 7.5 formed a local beta-sheet conformation at the central region and exhibited a random coil at the C-terminus region. Not only a hydrophobic interaction among the amphiphilic alpha-helices, but also an electrostatic interaction between charged side chains can play an important role for the fibril formation at pH 7.5 and 3.3 acting as electrostatically favorable and unfavorable interactions, respectively. These results suggest that hCT fibrils are formed by stacking antiparallel beta-sheets at pH 7.5 and a mixture of antiparallel and parallel beta-sheets at pH 3.3.",

We utilized the developed model to analyze what changes in a healthy neuron are likely to lead to the onset of \u03b1-syn aggregation. We checked the effects of interruption of \u03b1-syn transport toward the synapse, entry of misfolded (infectious) \u03b1-syn into the somatic and synaptic compartments, increasing the rate of \u03b1-syn synthesis in the soma, and failure of \u03b1-syn degradation machinery.

The traditional view that resolution of inflammation is a passive process is now being superceded by an alternative hypothesis whereby its resolution is an active, anti-inflammatory process that can be manipulated therapeutically. This shift in mindset has stimulated a resurgence of interest in the biological mechanisms by which inflammation resolves. The anti-inflammatory processes central to the resolution of inflammation revolve around macrophages and are closely related to pro-inflammatory processes mediated by neutrophils and their ability to damage healthy tissue. We develop a spatially averaged model of inflammation centring on its resolution, accounting for populations of neutrophils and macrophages and incorporating both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Our ordinary differential equation model exhibits two outcomes that we relate to healthy and unhealthy states. We use bifurcation analysis to investigate how variation in the system parameters affects its outcome. We find that therapeutic manipulation of the rate of macrophage phagocytosis can aid in resolving inflammation but success is critically dependent on the rate of neutrophil apoptosis. Indeed our model predicts that an effective treatment protocol would take a dual approach, targeting macrophage phagocytosis alongside neutrophil apoptosis.",

Using biochemical data and computational modeling, we show that the Ring1B ligase can exhibit abrupt switches, overshoot transitions and self-perpetuating oscillations between its distinct ubiquitination and activity states. These different Ring1B states display canonical or multiply branched, atypical polyubiquitin chains and involve association with the Polycomb-group protein Bmi1. Bistable switches and oscillations may lead to all-or-none histone H2A monoubiquitination rates and result in discrete periods of gene (in)activity.

We focus on a computational model to characterize whole body uptake and clearance, liver transport and phase I and phase II metabolism. We do this by incorporating sub-models that span three scales; Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of acetaminophen uptake and distribution at the whole body level, cell and blood flow modeling at the tissue\/organ level and metabolism at the sub-cellular level. We have used standard modeling modalities at each of the three scales. In particular, we have used the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) to create both the whole-body and sub-cellular scales. Our modeling approach allows us to run the individual sub-models separately and allows us to easily exchange models at a particular scale without the need to extensively rework the sub-models at other scales. In addition, the use of SBML greatly facilitates the inclusion of biological annotations directly in the model code. The model was calibrated using human in vivo data for acetaminophen and its sulfate and glucuronate metabolites. We then carried out extensive parameter sensitivity studies including the pairwise interaction of parameters. We also simulated population variation of exposure and sensitivity to acetaminophen. Our modeling framework can be extended to the prediction of liver toxicity following acetaminophen overdose, or used as a general purpose pharmacokinetic model for xenobiotics.",

Helicobacter pylori is the dominant member of the gastric microbiota and exerts both beneficial and harmful effects on the host. Chronic inflammation in the context of H. pylori has been linked to an upregulation in T helper (Th)1 and Th17 CD4+ T cell phenotypes, controlled in part by the cytokine, interleukin-21. This study investigates the differentiation and regulation of Tfh cells, major producers of IL-21, in the immune response to H. pylori challenge. To better understand the conditions influencing the promotion and inhibition of a chronically elevated Tfh population, we used top-down and bottom-up approaches to develop computational models of Tfh and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell differentiation. Stability analysis was used to characterize the presence of two bi-stable steady states in the calibrated Tfh\/Tfr models. Stochastic simulation was used to illustrate the ability of the parameter set to dictate two distinct behavioral patterns. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis helped identify the importance of various parameters on the establishment of Tfh and Tfr cell populations. The core network model was expanded into a more comprehensive and predictive model by including cytokine production and signaling pathways. From the expanded network, the interaction between TGFB-Induced Factor Homeobox 1 (Tgif1) and the retinoid X receptor (RXR) was displayed to exert control over the determination of the Tfh response. Model simulations predict that Tgif1 and RXR respectively induce and curtail Tfh responses. This computational hypothesis was validated experimentally by assaying Tgif1, RXR and Tfh in stomachs of mice infected with H. pylori.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Meiosis is the sexual reproduction process common to eukaryotes. The diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes meiosis in sporulation medium to form four haploid spores. Initiation of the process is tightly controlled by intricate networks of positive and negative feedback loops. Intriguingly, expression of early meiotic proteins occurs within a narrow time window. Further, sporulation efficiency is strikingly different for yeast strains with distinct mutations or genetic backgrounds. To investigate signal transduction pathways that regulate transient protein expression and sporulation efficiency, we develop a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations. The model describes early meiotic events, particularly feedback mechanisms at the system level and phosphorylation of signaling molecules for regulating protein activities. RESULTS: The mathematical model is capable of simulating the orderly and transient dynamics of meiotic proteins including Ime1, the master regulator of meiotic initiation, and Ime2, a kinase encoded by an early gene. The model is validated by quantitative sporulation phenotypes of single-gene knockouts. Thus, we can use the model to make novel predictions on the cooperation between proteins in the signaling pathway. Virtual perturbations on feedback loops suggest that both positive and negative feedback loops are required to terminate expression of early meiotic proteins. Bifurcation analyses on feedback loops indicate that multiple feedback loops are coordinated to modulate sporulation efficiency. In particular, positive auto-regulation of Ime2 produces a bistable system with a normal meiotic state and a more efficient meiotic state. CONCLUSIONS: By systematically scanning through feedback loops in the mathematical model, we demonstrate that, in yeast, the decisions to terminate protein expression and to sporulate at different efficiencies stem from feedback signals toward the master regulator Ime1 and the early meiotic protein Ime2. We argue that the architecture of meiotic initiation pathway generates a robust mechanism that assures a rapid and complete transition into meiosis. This type of systems-level regulation is a commonly used mechanism controlling developmental programs in yeast and other organisms. Our mathematical model uncovers key regulations that can be manipulated to enhance sporulation efficiency, an important first step in the development of new strategies for producing gametes with high quality and quantity.",

To date, a number of crystal structures of natural and synthetic ligands complexed to their target proteins have been solved, providing molecular level snap-shots of ligand binding. However, a deeper understanding of\nreceptor and ligand flexibility and conformational freedom is required to develop stable and effective ATRA analogues for clinical use. Therefore, we have used molecular modelling techniques to define RAR interactions with ATRA and two synthetic analogues, EC19 and EC23, and compared their predicted biochemical\nactivities to experimental measurements of relative ligand affinity and recruitment of coactivator proteins. A comprehensive molecular docking approach that explored the conformational space of the ligands indicated that ATRA is able to bind the three RAR proteins in a number of conformations with one extended\nstructure being favoured. In contrast the biologically-distinct isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9CRA), showed\nsignificantly less conformational flexibility in the RAR binding pockets. These findings were used to inform\ndocking studies of the synthetic retinoids EC23 and EC19, and their respective methyl esters. EC23 was\nfound to be an excellent mimic for ATRA, and occupied similar binding modes to ATRA in all three target\nRAR proteins. In comparison, EC19 exhibited an alternative binding mode which reduces the strength of\nkey polar interactions in RAR\u00ce\u00b1\/\u00ce\u00b3 but is well-suited to the larger RAR\u00ce\u00b2 binding pocket. In contrast, docking of the corresponding esters revealed the loss of key polar interactions which may explain the much reduced biological activity. Our computational results were complemented using an in vitro binding assay\nbased on FRET measurements, which showed that EC23 was a strongly binding, pan-agonist of the RARs,\nwhile EC19 exhibited specificity for RAR\u00ce\u00b2, as predicted by the docking studies. These findings can account for the distinct behaviour of EC23 and EC19 in cellular differentiation assays, and additionally, the methods described herein can be further applied to the understanding of the molecular basis for the selectivity of different retinoids to RAR\u00ce\u00b1, \u00ce\u00b2 and \u00ce\u00b3.",

Although they are secreted in inactive forms, they can activate each other through proteolytic cleavage. This mutual interplay creates the potential for complex dynamics, which we investigated using mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments. We constructed ordinary differential equations to model the conversion of precursor plasminogen into active PLS, and precursor urokinase (scUPA) into active urokinase (tcUPA). Although neither PLS nor UPA exhibits allosteric cooperativity, modeling showed that cooperativity occurred at the system level because of substrate competition. Computational simulations and bifurcation analysis predicted that the system would be bistable over a range of parameters for cooperativity and positive feedback. Cell-free experiments with recombinant proteins tested key predictions of the model. PLS activation in response to scUPA stimulus was found to be cooperative in vitro. Finally, bistability was demonstrated in vitro by the presence of two significantly different steady-state levels of PLS activation for the same levels of stimulus. We conclude that ultrasensitive, bistable activation of UPA-PLS is possible in the presence of substrate competition. An ultrasensitive threshold for activation of PLS and UPA would have ramifications for normal and disease processes, including angiogenesis, metastasis, wound healing, and fibrosis.",

Those efforts have produced a number of models of ever increasing complexity. Here, we present an alternative model that combines a low number of equations and parameters, similar to the very earliest models, with the complex network structure found in more recent ones. This simple model describes the temporal evolution of the abundance of eight clock gene mRNA\/protein and captures key features of the clock on a qualitative level, namely the entrained and free-running behaviors of the wild type clock, as well as the defects found in knockout mutants (such as altered free-running periods, lack of entrainment, or changes in the expression of other clock genes). Additionally, our model produces complex responses to various light cues, such as extreme photoperiods and non-24 h environmental cycles, and can describe the control of hypocotyl growth by the clock.

This setback highlights the need for new approaches for pre-clinical testing of possible interventions. Systems modelling is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable tool for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in ageing and age-related diseases. However, there is still a lack of awareness of modelling approaches in many areas of biomedical research. We previously developed a stochastic computer model to examine some of the key pathways involved in the aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and the micro-tubular binding protein tau. Here we show how we extended this model to include the main processes involved in passive and active immunisation against A\u03b2 and then demonstrate the effects of this intervention on soluble A\u03b2, plaques, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The model predicts that immunisation leads to clearance of plaques but only results in small reductions in levels of soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles. The behaviour of this model is supported by neuropathological observations in Alzheimer patients immunised against A\u03b2. Since, soluble A\u03b2, phosphorylated tau and tangles more closely correlate with cognitive decline than plaques, our model suggests that immunotherapy against A\u03b2 may not be effective unless it is performed very early in the disease process or combined with other therapies.",

While it is clear that chemical oxidation can cleave folates or damage their pterin precursors, very little is known about enzymatic damage to these molecules or about whether the folate biosynthesis pathway responds adaptively to damage to its end-products. The presence of a duplication of the gene encoding the folate biosynthesis enzyme 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (FolK) in many sequenced bacterial genomes combined with a strong chromosomal clustering of the folK gene with panB, encoding the 5,10-methylene-THF-dependent enzyme ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase, led us to infer that PanB has a side activity that cleaves 5,10-methylene-THF, yielding a pterin product that is recycled by FolK. Genetic and metabolic analyses of Escherichia coli strains showed that overexpression of PanB leads to accumulation of the likely folate cleavage product 6-hydroxymethylpterin and other pterins in cells and medium, and-unexpectedly-to a 46% increase in total folate content. In silico modeling of the folate biosynthesis pathway showed that these observations are consistent with the in vivo cleavage of 5,10-methylene-THF by a side-activity of PanB, with FolK-mediated recycling of the pterin cleavage product, and with regulation of folate biosynthesis by folates or their damage products.",

To delineate aa-stimulated mTOR network dynamics, we here combine a computational-experimental approach with text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase \u03b2 (CaMKK\u03b2). In response, AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy.

Here, we use FRET-based reporters to show that a global spread of ATM activity on chromatin and phosphorylation of ATM targets including KAP1 control Plk1 re-activation. These phosphorylations are rapidly counteracted by the chromatin-bound phosphatase Wip1, allowing cell cycle restart despite persistent ATM activity present at DNA lesions.

Despite cellular robustness, specific genetic or epigenetic changes of any gene can trigger a cascade of failures, which result in the malfunctioning of cell signaling pathways and lead to cancer phenotypes. The extent of cellular robustness has a link with the architecture of the network such as feedback and feedforward loops. Perturbation in components within feedback loops causes a transition from a regulated to a persistently activated state and results in uncontrolled cell growth. This work represents the mathematical and quantitative modeling of ERK, PI3K\/Akt, and Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling crosstalk to show the dynamics of signaling responses during genetic and epigenetic changes in cancer.

It has been repeatedly seen that macrophages form a significant proportion of the tumour mass, and that they can have a variety of effects upon the tumour, leading to a delicate balance between growth promotion and inhibition. This paper develops a model for the early, avascular growth of a tumour, concentrating on the inhibitory effect of macrophages due to their cytolytic activity. It is shown that such an immune response is not sufficient to prevent growth, due to it being a second-order process with respect to the density of the tumour cells present. However, the presence of macrophages does have important effects on the tumour composition, and the authors perform a detailed bifurcation analysis of their model to clarify this. An extended model is also considered which incorporates addition of exogenous chemical regulators. In this case, the model admits the possibility of tumour regression, and the therapeutic implications of this are discussed.",

Quantitative measurements of cell-cycle dynamics in single cells showed that despite variability in G1-, S-, and G2 phases, duration of mitosis is short and remarkably constant. Surprisingly, there is no correlation between cell-cycle length and mitotic duration, suggesting that mitosis is temporally insulated from variability in earlier cell-cycle phases. By combining live cell imaging and computational modeling, we showed that positive feedback is the molecular mechanism underlying the temporal insulation of mitosis. Perturbing positive feedback gave rise to a sluggish, variable entry and progression through mitosis and uncoupled duration of mitosis from variability in cell cycle length. We show that positive feedback is important to keep mitosis short, constant, and temporally insulated and anticipate it might be a commonly used regulatory strategy to create modularity in other biological systems.",

The stage of differentiation is therefore reflected in the positions of cells within the tissue, providing a convenient axis along which to study the signaling events that occur in situ during keratinocyte terminal differentiation, over this extended two-week timescale. The canonical ERK-MAPK signaling cascade (Raf-1, MEK-1\/2 and ERK-1\/2) has been implicated in controlling diverse cellular behaviors, including proliferation and differentiation. While the molecular interactions involved in signal transduction through this cascade have been well characterized in cell culture experiments, our understanding of how this sequence of events unfolds to determine cell fate within a homeostatic tissue environment has not been fully characterized.We measured the abundance of total and phosphorylated ERK-MAPK signaling proteins within interfollicular keratinocytes in transverse cross-sections of human epidermis using immunofluorescence microscopy. To investigate these data we developed a mathematical model of the signaling cascade using a normalized-Hill differential equation formalism.These data show coordinated variation in the abundance of phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components across the epidermis. Statistical analysis of these data shows that associations between phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components which correspond to canonical molecular interactions are dependent upon spatial position within the epidermis. The model demonstrates that the spatial profile of activation for ERK-MAPK signaling components across the epidermis may be maintained in a cell-autonomous fashion by an underlying spatial gradient in calcium signaling.Our data demonstrate an extended phospho-protein profile of ERK-MAPK signaling cascade components across the epidermis in situ, and statistical associations in these data indicate canonical ERK-MAPK interactions underlie this spatial profile of ERK-MAPK activation. Using mathematical modelling we have demonstrated that spatially varying calcium signaling components across the epidermis may be sufficient to maintain the spatial profile of ERK-MAPK signaling cascade components in a cell-autonomous manner. These findings may have significant implications for the wide range of cancer drugs which therapeutically target ERK-MAPK signaling components.",

However, the role of p21 in maintaining genomic stability in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging agents is unclear. Here, using live single-cell measurements of p21 protein in proliferating cultures, we show that naturally occurring DNA damage incurred over S-phase causes p53-dependent accumulation of p21 during mother G2- and daughter G1-phases. High p21 levels mediate G1 arrest via CDK inhibition, yet lower levels have no impact on G1 progression, and the ubiquitin ligases CRL4Cdt2 and SCFSkp2 couple to degrade p21 prior to the G1\/S transition. Mathematical modelling reveals that a bistable switch, created by CRL4Cdt2, promotes irreversible S-phase entry by keeping p21 levels low, preventing premature S-phase exit upon DNA damage. Thus, we characterize how p21 regulates the proliferation-quiescence decision to maintain genomic stability.",

One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.",

We use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their own stimulation. We show that such autocatalytic cell division can significantly enhance virus spread, and can also provide an additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral drug therapy. In addition, the initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their extinction. On the other hand, a low initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of HIV-specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune impairment, lead to less efficient anti-viral effector responses, and thus speed up disease progression, especially if effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently boosted at the same time.",

We computationally modeled and experimentally tested signal processing in the FGFR\/MC1R\/B-Raf\/C-Raf\/MAPK1,2 network in human melanoma cells; identifying 7 regulatory loops and a bifan motif. Signaling from FGFR leads to sustained activation of MAPK1,2, whereas signaling from MC1R results in transient activation of MAPK1,2. The dynamics of MAPK activation depends critically on the expression level and connectivity to C-Raf, which is critical for a sustained MAPK1,2 response. A partially incoherent bifan motif with a feedback loop acts as a logic gate to integrate signals and regulate duration of activation of the MAPK signaling cascade.

We derived equations for the maximum tumor size, doubling time, and the minimum amount of chemotherapy needed to suppress the tumor and used a sample data set to compare how these quantities differ based on choice of growth model.We find that there is a 12-fold difference in predicting doubling times and a 6-fold difference in the predicted amount of chemotherapy needed for suppression depending on which growth model was used.Our results highlight the need for careful consideration of model assumptions when developing mathematical models for use in cancer treatment planning.",

A two-dimensional linear differential equation model of the hormone is formulated and is used to analyze plasma melatonin levels in 18 normal healthy male subjects during a constant routine. Recently developed Bayesian statistical procedures are used to incorporate correctly the magnitude of the immunoassay error into the analysis. The estimated parameters [median (range)] were clearance half-life of 23.67 (14.79-59.93) min, synthesis onset time of 2206 (1940-0029), synthesis offset time of 0621 (0246-0817), and maximum N-acetyltransferase activity of 7.17(2.34-17.93) pmol x l(-1) x min(-1). All were in good agreement with values from previous reports. The difference between synthesis offset time and the phase of the core temperature minimum was 1 h 15 min (-4 h 38 min-2 h 43 min). The correlation between synthesis onset and the dim light melatonin onset was 0.93. Our model provides a more physiologically plausible estimate of the melatonin synthesis onset time than that given by the dim light melatonin onset and the first reliable means of estimating the phase of synthesis offset. Our analysis shows that the circadian and pharmacokinetics parameters of melatonin can be reliably estimated from a single model.",

In recent years, many elegant experiments on budding yeast have dissected the roles of cyclin molecules (Cln1-3 and Clb1-6) in coordinating the events of DNA synthesis, bud emergence, spindle formation, nuclear division, and cell separation. These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation. Using standard techniques of biochemical kinetics, we convert the mechanism into a set of differential equations, which describe the time courses of three major classes of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Model in hand, we examine the molecular events controlling \"Start\" (the commitment step to a new round of chromosome replication, bud formation, and mitosis) and \"Finish\" (the transition from metaphase to anaphase, when sister chromatids are pulled apart and the bud separates from the mother cell) in wild-type cells and 50 mutants. The model accounts for many details of the physiology, biochemistry, and genetics of cell cycle control in budding yeast.",

Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy stopped-flow measurements used the fluorescent GTP analogue, mantGTP (2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)GTP), to determine rate constants for binding and release of neurofibromin. Quenched flow measurements provided the kinetics of the hydrolytic cleavage step. The fluorescent phosphate sensor, MDCC-PBP was used to measure phosphate release kinetics. Phosphate-water oxygen exchange, using (18)O-substituted GTP and inorganic phosphate (P(i)), was used to determine the extent of reversal of the hydrolysis step and of P(i) binding. The data show that neurofibromin and P(i) dissociate from the NF1.Ras.GDP.P(i) complex with identical kinetics, which are 3-fold slower than the preceding cleavage step. A model is presented in which the P(i) release is associated with the change of Ras from \"GTP\" to \"GDP\" conformation. In this model, the conformation change on P(i) release causes the large change in affinity of neurofibromin, which then dissociates rapidly.",

Nevertheless, the behavior of the cycle is very complicated since many substrates alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions that produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other enzymes in the cycle. The model consists of four differential equations, based on known reaction kinetics, that can be solved to give the time course of the concentrations of the four main substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show that the behavior of the model in response to genetic abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies. We conduct computational \"experiments\" that give understanding of the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle under normal conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic variation and dietary deficiencies.",

This decision to temporarily exit the cell cycle is essential to prevent the propagation of mutations, and most cancer cells harbor defects in the underlying control system. Here we present a mechanistic mathematical model to study the proliferation-quiescence decision in nontransformed human cells. We show that two bistable switches, the restriction point (RP) and the G1\/S transition, mediate this decision by integrating DNA damage and mitogen signals. In particular, our data suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Cip1\/Waf1), which is expressed in response to DNA damage, promotes quiescence by blocking positive feedback loops that facilitate G1 progression downstream of serum stimulation. Intriguingly, cells exploit bistability in the RP to convert graded p21 and mitogen signals into an all-or-nothing cell-cycle response. The same mechanism creates a window of opportunity where G1 cells that have passed the RP can revert to quiescence if exposed to DNA damage. We present experimental evidence that cells gradually lose this ability to revert to quiescence as they progress through G1 and that the onset of rapid p21 degradation at the G1\/S transition prevents this response altogether, insulating S phase from mild, endogenous DNA damage. Thus, two bistable switches conspire in the early cell cycle to provide both sensitivity and robustness to external stimuli.",

The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens.

In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed.

        "abstract":"Cancer immunotherapies rely on how interactions between cancer and immune system cells are constituted. The more essential to the emergence of the dynamical behavior of cancer growth these are, the more effectively they may be used as mechanisms for interventions. Mathematical modeling can help unearth such connections, and help explain how they shape the dynamics of cancer growth. Here, we explored whether there exist simple, consistent properties of cancer-immune system interaction (CISI) models that might be harnessed to devise effective immunotherapy approaches. We did this for a family of three related models of increasing complexity. To this end, we developed a base model of CISI, which captures some essential features of the more complex models built on it. We find that the base model and its derivates can reproduce biologically plausible behavior. This behavior is consistent with situations in which the suppressive effects exerted by cancer cells on immune cells dominate their proliferative effects. Under these circumstances, the model family may display a pattern of bistability, where two distinct, stable states (a cancer-free, and a full-grown cancer state) are possible, consistent with the notion of an immunological barrier. Increasing the effectiveness of immune-caused cancer cell killing may remove the basis for bistability, and abruptly tip the dynamics of the system into cancer-free state. In combination with the administration of immune effector cells, modifications in cancer cell killing may also be harnessed for immunotherapy without resolving the bistability. We use these ideas to test immunotherapeutic interventions in silico in a stochastic version of the base model. This bistability-reliant approach to cancer interventions might offer advantages over those that comprise gradual declines in cancer cell numbers.",

One of the reasons is the lack of understanding on the complex interplay between tumor growth dynamics and the associated immune system responses. Toward this goal, we consider a mathematical model of vascularized tumor growth and the corresponding effector cell recruitment dynamics. Bifurcation analysis allows for the exploration of model's dynamic behavior and the determination of these parameter regimes that result in immune-mediated tumor control. In this work, we focus on a particular tumor evasion regime that involves tumor and effector cell concentration oscillations of slowly increasing and decreasing amplitude, respectively. Considering a temporal multiscale analysis, we derive an analytically tractable mapping of model solutions onto a weakly negatively damped harmonic oscillator. Based on our analysis, we propose a theory-driven intervention strategy involving immunostimulating and immunosuppressive phases to induce long-term tumor control.",

These models, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving individual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common characteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do the outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the other? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using established mathematical models of immune interactions with early-stage cancer. These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and the simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our results show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e. implementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of models however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be modelled. In some cases, additional insight from using agent-based modelling was obtained. Overall, we can confirm that agent-based modelling is a useful addition to the tool set of immunologists, as it has extra features that allow for simulations with characteristics that are closer to the biological phenomena.",

The simplified predator-prey model includes four lumped parameters: tumor growth rate, g; immune cell killing efficiency, k; immune cell signaling factor, \u03bb; and immune cell half-life decay, \u03bc. The predator-prey equations as functions of time, t, for normalized tumor cell numbers, y, (the prey) and immunocyte numbers, \u00d7, (the predators) are: dy\/dt = gy - kx and dx\/dt = \u03bbxy - \u03bcx. A parameter estimation procedure that capitalizes on available clinical data and the timing of clinically observable phenomena gives mid-range benchmarks for parameters representing the unstable equilibrium case in which the tumor neither grows nor shrinks. Departure from this equilibrium results in oscillations in tumor cell numbers and in many cases complete elimination of the tumor. Several paradoxical phenomena are predicted, including increasing tumor cell numbers prior to a population crash, apparent cure with late recurrence, one or more cycles of tumor growth prior to eventual tumor elimination, and improved tumor killing with initially weaker immune parameters or smaller initial populations of immune cells. The model and the parameter estimation techniques are easily adapted to various human cancers that evoke an immune response. They may help clinicians understand and predict certain strange and unexpected effects in the world of tumor immunity and lead to the design of clinical trials to test improved treatment protocols for patients.",

IL-21 is now developed as a cancer immunotherapeutic drug, but conditions for efficacious therapy, and the conflicting immunostimulatory and immunoinhibitory influence of the cytokine, are yet to be defined. We studied the effects of IL-21 on tumor eradication in a mathematical model focusing on natural killer (NK) cell-mediated and CD8+ T-cell-mediated lysis of tumor cells. Model parameters were estimated using results in tumor-bearing mice treated with IL-21 via cytokine gene therapy (CGT), hydrodynamics-based gene delivery (HGD), or standard interval dosing (SID). Our model accurately retrieved experimental growth dynamics in the nonimmunogenic B16 melanoma and the immunogenic MethA and MCA205 fibrosarcomas, showing a strong dependence of the NK-cell\/CD8+ T-cell balance on tumor immunogenicity. Moreover, in melanoma, simulations of CGT-like dosing regimens, dynamically determined according to tumor mass changes, resulted in efficient disease elimination. In contrast, in fibrosarcoma, such a strategy was not superior to that of fixed dosing regimens, HGD or SID. Our model supports clinical use of IL-21 as a potent stimulator of cellular immunity against cancer, and suggests selecting the immunotherapy strategy according to tumor immunogenicity. Nonimmunogenic tumors, but not highly immunogenic tumors, should be controlled by IL-21 dosing, which depends on tumor mass at the time of administration. This method imitates, yet amplifies, the natural anticancer immune response rather than accelerates only one of the response arms in an unbalanced manner.",

Here we make an initial investigation into this problem with the help of a mathematical model for oncolytic virotherapy; although the model can in fact be made general enough to be applied also to other immunological problems. According to this model, we find that long-term cancer control is associated with a large number of persistent effector cells (irrespective of the initial peak in effector cell numbers). However, this large number of persistent effector cells is sustained by a relatively large number of memory cells. Moreover, the results of the mathematical model suggest that cancer control from a dormant state cannot be predicted by the size of the memory population.",

In the simplest case, such as the checkpoint-free situation encountered in early amphibian embryos, the frequency of CDC oscillations can be increased or decreased by regulating the rate of synthesis, the binding rate, or the equilibrium constant of the binding protein. In a more complex model of cell division, where size-control checkpoints are included, we show that the same reversible binding reaction can alter the mean cell mass in a continuously dividing cell.

In a variety of cell types, the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback loops, positive or negative, depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of the initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation.

We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components.

        "abstract":"A mathematical description of polyglutamated folate kinetics for human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) has been formulated based upon experimental folate, methotrexate (MTX), purine, and pyrimidine pool sizes as well as reaction rate parameters obtained from intact MCF-7 cells and their enzyme isolates. The schema accounts for the interconversion of highly polyglutamated tetrahydrofolate, 5-methyl-FH4, 5-10-CH2FH4, dihydrofolate (FH2), 10-formyl-FH4 (FFH4), and 10-formyl-FH2 (FFH2), as well as formation and transport of the MTX polyglutamates. Inhibition mechanisms have been chosen to reproduce all observed non-, un-, and pure competition inhibition patterns. Steady state folate concentrations and thymidylate and purine synthesis rates in drug-free intact cells were used to determine normal folate Vmax values. The resulting average-cell folate model, examined for its ability to predict folate pool behavior following exposure to 1 microM MTX over 21 h, agreed well with the experiment, including a relative preservation of the FFH4 and CH2FH4 pools. The results depend strongly on thymidylate synthase (TS) reaction mechanism, especially the assumption that MTX di- and triglutamates inhibit TS synthesis as greatly in the intact cell as they do with purified enzyme. The effects of cell cycle dependence of TS and dihydrofolate reductase activities were also examined by introducing G- to S-phase activity ratios of these enzymes into the model. For activity ratios down to at least 5%, cell population averaged folate pools were only slightly affected, while CH2FH4 pools in S-phase cells were reduced to as little as 10% of control values. Significantly, these folate pool dynamics were indicated to arise from both direct inhibition by MTX polyglutamates as well as inhibition by elevated levels of polyglutamated FH2 and FFH2.",

        "abstract":"In Drosophila, circadian oscillations in the levels of two proteins, PER and TIM, result from the negative feedback exerted by a PER-TIM complex on the expression of the per and tim genes which code for these two proteins. On the basis of these experimental observations, we have recently proposed a theoretical model for circadian oscillations of the PER and TIM proteins in Drosophila. Here we show that for constant environmental conditions this model is capable of generating autonomous chaotic oscillations. For other parameter values, the model can also display birhythmicity, i.e. the coexistence between two stable regimes of limit cycle oscillations. We analyse the occurrence of chaos and birhythmicity by means of bifurcation diagrams and locate the different domains of complex oscillatory behavior in parameter space. The relative smallness of these domains raises doubts as to the possible physiological significance of chaos and birhythmicity in regard to circadian rhythm generation. Beyond the particular context of circadian rhythms we discuss the results in the light of other mechanisms underlying chaos and birhythmicity in regulated biological systems.

After the discovery of per and tim, a model with a simple feedback loop involving per and tim has been proposed. However, it is recognized that the simple feedback model cannot account for phenotypes generated by various mutants. A recent report by Glossop, Lyons & Hardin [Science286, 766 (1999)] on Drosophila suggests involvement of another feedback loop by dClk that is interlocked with per-tim feedback loop. In order to examine whether interlocked feedback loops can be a basic mechanism for circadian rhythms, a mathematical model was created and examined. Through extensive simulation and mathematical analysis, it was revealed that the interlocked feedback model accounts for the observations that are not explained by the simple feedback model. Moreover, the interlocked feedback model has robust properties in oscillations.",

        "abstract":"Sucrose accumulation in developing sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) is accompanied by a continuous synthesis and cleavage of sucrose in the storage tissues. Despite numerous studies, the factors affecting sucrose accumulation are still poorly understood, and no consistent pattern has emerged which pinpoints certain enzyme activities as important controlling steps. Here, we develop an approach based on pathway analysis and kinetic modelling to assess the biochemical control of sucrose accumulation and futile cycling in sugar cane. By using the concept of elementary flux modes, all possible routes of futile cycling of sucrose were enumerated in the metabolic system. The available kinetic data for the pathway enzymes were then collected and assembled in a kinetic model of sucrose accumulation in sugar cane culm tissue. Although no data were fitted, the model agreed well with independent experimental results: in no case was the difference between calculated and measured fluxes and concentrations greater than 2-fold. The model thus validated was then used to assess different enhancement strategies for increasing sucrose accumulation. First, the control coefficient of each enzyme in the system on futile cycling of sucrose was calculated. Secondly, the activities of those enzymes with the numerically largest control coefficients were varied over a 5-fold range to determine the effect on the degree of futile cycling, the conversion efficiency from hexoses into sucrose, and the net sucrose accumulation rate. In view of the modelling results, overexpression of the fructose or glucose transporter or the vacuolar sucrose import protein, as well as reduction of cytosolic neutral invertase levels, appear to be the most promising targets for genetic manipulation. This offers a more directed improvement strategy than cumbersome gene-by-gene manipulation. The kinetic model can be viewed and interrogated on the World Wide Web at http:\/\/jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za.",

A key difficulty with signaling models is that, while significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these networks, many of the parameters required to describe their behavior remain unknown or at best represent estimates. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods toward modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. In particular, we study the actions of NGF and mitogenic epidermal growth factor (EGF) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Through a network of intermediate signaling proteins, each of these growth factors stimulates extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation with distinct dynamical profiles. Using our modeling approach, we are able to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems that we call 'sloppiness.'",

Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations.

A kinetic model of the sporulation control network is developed, which is then used to demonstrate how the mechanisms of TRSC can be understood and simulated at the kinetic level.

It is also shown how gene dosage-effect relationships can be employed for network analysis.

To address the issue of whether the behavior in vivo of the PTS can be understood in terms of these enzyme kinetics, a detailed kinetic model was constructed. Each overall phosphotransfer reaction was separated into two elementary reactions, the first entailing association of the phosphoryl donor and acceptor into a complex and the second entailing dissociation of the complex into dephosphorylated donor and phosphorylated acceptor. Literature data on the K(m) values and association constants of PTS proteins for their substrates, as well as equilibrium and rate constants for the overall phosphotransfer reactions, were related to the rate constants of the elementary steps in a set of equations; the rate constants could be calculated by solving these equations simultaneously. No kinetic parameters were fitted. As calculated by the model, the kinetic parameter values in vitro could describe experimental results in vivo when varying each of the PTS protein concentrations individually while keeping the other protein concentrations constant. Using the same kinetic constants, but adjusting the protein concentrations in the model to those present in cell-free extracts, the model could reproduce experiments in vitro analyzing the dependence of the flux on the total PTS protein concentration. For modeling conditions in vivo it was crucial that the PTS protein concentrations be implemented at their high in vivo values. The model suggests a new interpretation of results hitherto not understood; in vivo, the major fraction of the PTS proteins may exist as complexes with other PTS proteins or boundary metabolites, whereas in vitro, the fraction of complexed proteins is much smaller.",

Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority ( approximately 80%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode.",

In most cell types the mechanism of regular spiking is well understood and models based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) can account for many experimental observations. However, cells do not always exhibit simple Ca(2+) oscillations. In response to given agonists, some cells show more complex behaviour in the form of bursting, i.e. trains of Ca(2+) spikes separated by silent phases. Here we develop several theoretical models, based on physiologically plausible assumptions, that could account for complex intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations. The models are all based on one- or two-pool models based on CICR. We extend these models by (i) considering the inhibition of the Ca(2+)-release channel on a unique intracellular store at high cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, (ii) taking into account the Ca(2+)-activated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), or (iii) considering explicity the evolution of the Ca(2+) concentration in two different pools, one sensitive and the other one insensitive to IP(3). Besides simple periodic oscillations, these three models can all account for more complex oscillatory behaviour in the form of bursting. Moreover, the model that takes the kinetics of IP(3) into account shows chaotic behaviour.",

These intermediates inactivate many types of biomolecules, including peroxidase itself. Previously, we have shown that oscillatory dynamics in the peroxidase-oxidase reaction seem to protect the enzyme from inactivation. It was suggested that this is due to a lower average concentration of reactive oxygen species in the oscillatory state compared to the steady state. Here, we studied the peroxidase-oxidase reaction with either 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or melatonin as cofactors. We show that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is present in both cases. We also found that the enzyme degradation depends on the concentration of the cofactor and on the pH of the reaction mixture. We simulated the oscillatory behaviour, including the oscillation\/steady state bistability observed experimentally, using a detailed reaction scheme. The computational results confirm the hypothesis that protection is due to lower average concentrations of superoxide radical during oscillations. They also show that the shape of the oscillations changes with increasing cofactor concentration resulting in a further decrease in the average concentration of radicals. We therefore hypothesize that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is a general effect in this system.",

The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed. These results suggest that therapy using viruses could be an alternative to extend the survival of AIDS patients.",

The four outbreaks of the avian influenza A H7N9 in China from March 2013 to June 2016 have resulted in 580 human cases including 202 deaths with a death rate of nearly 35%.

We obtain a threshold value for the prevalence of avian influenza and investigate the local or global asymptotical stability of each equilibrium of these systems by using linear analysis technique or combining Liapunov function method and LaSalle's invariance principle, respectively.

To improve virus survival and infectivity Kim et al. (Biomaterials 32(9):2314-2326, 2011) modified virus particles with the polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the monoclonal antibody herceptin. Whilst PEG modification appeared to improve plasma retention and initial infectivity, it also increased the virus particle arrival time. We derive a mathematical model that describes the interaction between tumour cells and an oncolytic virus. We tune our model to represent the experimental data by Kim et\u00a0al.

Our model provides a platform from which predictions may be made about the response of cancer growth to other treatment protocols beyond those in the experiments.

Cancer must grow in a primary site, extravasate and survive in the circulation to then intravasate into target organ (invasive species survival in transport). Cancer cells often lay dormant at their metastatic site for a long period of time (lag period for invasive species) before proliferating (invasive spread). Proliferation in the new site has an impact on the target organ microenvironment (ecological impact) and eventually the human host (biosphere impact).Tilman has described mathematical equations for the competition between invasive species in a structured habitat. These equations were adapted to study the invasion of cancer cells into the bone marrow microenvironment as a structured habitat. A large proportion of solid tumor metastases are bone metastases, known to usurp hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) homing pathways to establish footholds in the bone marrow. This required accounting for the fact that this is the natural home of hematopoietic stem cells and that they already occupy this structured space. The adapted Tilman model of invasion dynamics is especially valuable for modeling the lag period or dormancy of cancer cells.The Tilman equations for modeling the invasion of two species into a defined space have been modified to study the invasion of cancer cells into the bone marrow microenvironment. These modified equations allow a more flexible way to model the space competition between the two cell species. The ability to model initial density, metastatic seeding into the bone marrow and growth once the cells are present, and movement of cells out of the bone marrow niche and apoptosis of cells are all aspects of the adapted equations. These equations are currently being applied to clinical data sets for verification and further refinement of the models.",

To maintain a normal cell physiology, it is critical that the control of Myc dynamics is precisely orchestrated. Recent studies suggest that such control of Myc can be achieved at the post-translational level via protein stability modulation. Myc is regulated by two Ras effector pathways: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. To gain quantitative insight into Myc dynamics, we have developed a mathematical model to analyze post-translational regulation of Myc via sequential phosphorylation by Erk and PI3K. Our results suggest that Myc integrates Erk and PI3K signals to result in various cellular responses by differential stability control of Myc protein isoforms. Such signal integration confers a flexible dynamic range for the system output, governed by stability change. In addition, signal integration may require saturation of the input signals, leading to sensitive signal integration to the temporal features of the input signals, insensitive response to their amplitudes, and resistance to input fluctuations. We further propose that these characteristics of the protein stability control module in Myc may be commonly utilized in various cell types and classes of proteins.",

As a signal integrator, mTOR shows a complex dynamical behavior which determines the cell fate at different cellular processes levels, including cell cycle progression, cell survival, cell death, metabolic reprogramming, and aging. The dynamics of the complex responses to rapamycin in cancer cells have been attributed to its differential time-dependent inhibitory effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2, the two main complexes of mTOR. Two explanations were previously provided for this phenomenon: 1-Rapamycin does not inhibit mTORC2 directly, whereas it prevents mTORC2 formation by sequestering free mTOR protein (Le Chatelier's principle). 2-Components like Phosphatidic Acid (PA) further stabilize mTORC2 compared with mTORC1. To understand the mechanism by which rapamycin differentially inhibits the mTOR complexes in the cancer cells, we present a mathematical model of rapamycin mode of action based on the first explanation, i.e., Le Chatelier's principle. Translating the interactions among components of mTORC1 and mTORC2 into a mathematical model revealed the dynamics of rapamycin action in different doses and time-intervals of rapamycin treatment. This model shows that rapamycin has stronger effects on mTORC1 compared with mTORC2, simply due to its direct interaction with free mTOR and mTORC1, but not mTORC2, without the need to consider other components that might further stabilize mTORC2. Based on our results, even when mTORC2 is less stable compared with mTORC1, it can be less inhibited by rapamycin.",

The majority of Vicodin abusers were first introduced via prescription, unlike other drugs which are often experienced for the first time due to experimentation. Most abusers report obtaining their supply from a prescription, either their own or someone else's. Although the problem with prescription drug abuse is well known, there is no standard method of addressing the problem. To better understand how to do this, we develop and analyze a mathematical model of Vicodin use and abuse, considering only those patients who were initially prescribed the drug. Through global sensitivity analysis, we show that focusing efforts on abuse prevention rather than treatment has greater success at reducing the population of Vicodin abusers. Our results demonstrate that relying solely on rehabilitation and other treatment programs is not enough to combat the prescription drug problem in the United States.

However, viruses of microbes can also initiate chronic infections, in which new viruses particles are released via budding and without cell lysis. In chronic infections, viral genomes may also be passed on from mother to daughter cells during division. The consequences of chronic infections for the population dynamics of viruses and microbes remains under-explored. In this paper we present a model of chronic infections as well as a model of interactions between lytic and chronic viruses competing for the same microbial population. In the chronic only model, we identify conditions underlying complex bifurcations such as saddle-node, backward and Hopfbifurcations, leading to parameter regions with multiple attractors and\/or oscillatory behavior. We then utilize invasion analysis to examine the coupled nonlinear system of microbes, lytic viruses, and chronic viruses. In so doing we find unexpected results, including a regime in which the chronic virus requires the lytic virus for survival, invasion, and persistence. In this regime, lytic viruses decrease total cell densities, so that a subpopulation of chronically infected cells experience decreased niche competition. As such, even when chronically infected cells have a growth disadvantage, lytic viruses can, paradoxically, enable the proliferation of both chronically infected cells and chronic viruses. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the ecology and long-term evolution of heterogeneous viral strategies.",

        "abstract":"The normal wound healing response is characterized by a progression from clot formation, to an inflammatory phase, to a repair phase, and finally, to remodeling. In many chronic wounds there is an extended inflammatory phase that stops this progression. In order to understand the inflammatory phase in more detail, we developed an ordinary differential equation model that accounts for two systemic mediators that are known to modulate this phase, estrogen (a protective hormone during wound healing) and cortisol (a hormone elevated after trauma that slows healing). This model describes the interactions in the wound between wound debris, pathogens, neutrophils and macrophages and the modulation of these interactions by estrogen and cortisol. A collection of parameter sets, which qualitatively match published data on the dynamics of wound healing, was chosen using Latin Hypercube Sampling. This collection of parameter sets represents normal healing in the population as a whole better than one single parameter set. Including the effects of estrogen and cortisol is a necessary step to creating a patient specific model that accounts for gender and trauma. Utilization of math modeling techniques to better understand the wound healing inflammatory phase could lead to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic wounds. This inflammatory phase model will later become the inflammatory subsystem of our full wound healing model, which includes fibroblast activity, collagen accumulation and remodeling.",

        "abstract":"In plants, the partitioning of carbon resources between growth and defense is detrimental for their development. From a metabolic viewpoint, growth is mainly related to primary metabolism including protein, amino acid and lipid synthesis, whereas defense is based notably on the biosynthesis of a myriad of secondary metabolites. Environmental factors, such as nitrate fertilization, impact the partitioning of carbon resources between growth and defense. Indeed, experimental data showed that a shortage in the nitrate fertilization resulted in a reduction of the plant growth, whereas some secondary metabolites involved in plant defense, such as phenolic compounds, accumulated. Interestingly, sucrose, a key molecule involved in the transport and partitioning of carbon resources, appeared to be under homeostatic control. Based on the inflow\/outflow properties of sucrose homeostatic regulation we propose a global model on how the diversion of the primary carbon flux into the secondary phenolic pathways occurs at low nitrate concentrations. The model can account for the accumulation of starch during the light phase and the sucrose remobilization by starch degradation during the night. Day-length sensing mechanisms for variable light-dark regimes are discussed, showing that growth is proportional to the length of the light phase. The model can describe the complete starch consumption during the night for plants adapted to a certain light\/dark regime when grown on sufficient nitrate and can account for an increased accumulation of starch observed under nitrate limitation.",

Our model captures known immunological and molecular features such as impaired HPV-specific effector T helper 1 (Th1) cell responses, and enhanced HPV infection due to HIV. We used the model to determine HPV prognosis in the presence of HIV infection, and identified conditions under which HIV infection alters HPV persistence in the oral mucosa system. The model predicts that conditions leading to HPV persistence during HIV\/HPV co-infection are the permissive immune environment created by HIV and molecular interactions between the two viruses. The model also determines when HPV infection continues to persist in the short run in a co-infected patient undergoing antiretroviral therapy.

In this article, we propose a mathematical model for the treatment of tumors using oncolytic virus and chemotherapy. This model takes the form of nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the interactions between uninfected tumor cells, infected tumor cells, an oncolytic virus, and chemotherapy. It is assumed that the rate of infection between uninfected tumor cells and infected tumor cells is in a saturated form. The saturation effect takes into account the fact that the number of contacts between them reaches the maximum value when the immune system works to stop the virus. The dynamical analysis, which includes the existence of equilibrium points, and its stability analysis is investigated. The analysis result shows that the system has three equilibrium points: tumor-free equilibrium point, virus-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. It is proven that these equilibrium points are conditionally stable. The numerical simulations show the successful combination of chemotherapy and virotherapy using an oncolytic virus in eliminating the tumor cells.",

HTLV-I has been clinically linked to the development of adult T-cell leukaemia\/lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive blood cancer, and HAM\/TSP, a progressive neurological and inflammatory disease. Infected individuals typically mount a large, persistently activated CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against HTLV-I-infected cells, but ultimately fail to effectively eliminate the virus. Moreover, the identification of determinants to disease manifestation has thus far been elusive. A key issue in current HTLV-I research is to better understand the dynamic interaction between persistent infection by HTLV-I and virus-specific host immunity. Recent experimental hypotheses for the persistence of HTLV-I in vivo have led to the development of mathematical models illuminating the balance between proviral latency and activation in the target cell population. We investigate the role of a constantly changing anti-viral immune environment acting in response to the effects of infected T-cell activation and subsequent viral expression. The resulting model is a four-dimensional, non-linear system of ordinary differential equations that describes the dynamic interactions among viral expression, infected target cell activation, and the HTLV-I-specific CTL response. The global dynamics of the model is established through the construction of appropriate Lyapunov functions. Examining the particular roles of viral expression and host immunity during the chronic phase of HTLV-I infection offers important insights regarding the evolution of viral persistence and proposes a hypothesis for pathogenesis.",

Here, we present a novel model of the DNA damage signaling pathway that includes p53 and whole cell cycle regulation and explore the relationship between p53 oscillation and cell fate selection. The simulation run without DNA damage qualitatively realized experimentally observed data from several cell cycle regulators, indicating that our model was biologically appropriate. Moreover, the comprehensive sensitivity analysis for the proposed model was implemented by changing the values of all kinetic parameters, which revealed that the cell cycle regulation system based on the proposed model has robustness on a fluctuation of reaction rate in each process. Simulations run with four different intensities of DNA damage, i.e. Low-damage, Medium-damage, High-damage, and Excess-damage, realized cell cycle arrest in all cases.

At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC\/CCdh1 inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC\/CCdh1 bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1\/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC\/CCdh1 and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC\/CCdh1 bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC\/CCdh1.

These are in close agreement with observed patterns despite the fact that the model contains no mechanisms for the development of drug-resistant strains of virus. It is suggested that the patterns of viral abundance observed during the first 6 months after treatment may be the result of non-linearities in the interactions between HIV and CD4+ cells, and that it is only after the first post-treatment burst of viral production that drug resistance plays an important role.",

While the identification of an antigen as self\/non-self is critically important, the dynamic features of antigen presentation may also determine the immune system's response. Here, we use a simple mathematical model of immune activation to explore the idea of antigen discrimination through dynamics. We propose that antigen presentation is coupled to two nodes, one regulatory and one effecting the immune response, through an incoherent feedforward loop and repressive feedback. This circuit would allow the immune system to effectively estimate the increase of antigens with respect to time, a key determinant of immune reactivity in\u00a0vivo. Our model makes the prediction that tumors growing at specific rates evade the immune system despite the continuous presence of antigens indicating disease, a phenomenon closely related to clinically observed \"two-zone tolerance.\" Finally, we discuss a plausible biological instantiation of our circuit using combinations of regulatory and effector T\u00a0cells.",

Some models were proposed to examine the effect of circulating lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells, but they neglected the role of CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cells. Other models were constructed to study the role of CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cells but did not consider the role of other immune cells. In this study, we propose a mathematical model, in the form of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, that predicts the interaction between tumor cells and natural killer cells, CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cells, CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells, and circulating lymphocytes with or without immunotherapy and\/or chemotherapy. This system is stiff, and the Runge-Kutta method failed to solve it. Consequently, the \"Adams predictor-corrector\" method is used. The results reveal that the patient's immune system can overcome small tumors; however, if the tumor is large, adoptive therapy with CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cells can be an alternative to both CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cell therapy and cytokines in some cases. Moreover, CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cell therapy could replace chemotherapy depending upon tumor size. Even if a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy is necessary, using CD4<sup>+<\/sup>T cell therapy can better reduce the dose of the associated chemotherapy compared to using combined CD8<sup>+<\/sup>T cells and cytokine therapy. Stability analysis is performed for the studied patients. It has been found that all equilibrium points are unstable, and a condition for preventing tumor recurrence after treatment has been deduced. Finally, a bifurcation analysis is performed to study the effect of varying system parameters on the stability, and bifurcation points are specified. New equilibrium points are created or demolished at some bifurcation points, and stability is changed at some others. Hence, for systems turning to be stable, tumors can be eradicated without the possibility of recurrence. The proposed mathematical model provides a valuable tool for designing patients' treatment intervention strategies.",

They pose challenges in the field of medicine but can also have useful applications in industry. Regulation of biofilm growth is complex and still largely elusive. Oscillations are thought to be advantageous for biofilms to cope with nutrient starvation and chemical attacks. Recently, a minimal mathematical model has been employed to describe the oscillations in Bacillus subtilis biofilms. In this paper, we investigate four different modifications to that minimal model in order to better understand the oscillations in biofilms. Our first modification is towards making a gradient of metabolites from the center of the biofilm to the periphery. We find that it does not improve the model and is therefore, unnecessary. We then use realistic Michaelis-Menten kinetics to replace the highly simple mass-action kinetics for one of the reactions. Further, we use reversible reactions to mimic the diffusion in biofilms. As the final modification, we check the combined effect of using Michaelis-Menten kinetics and reversible reactions on the model behavior. We find that these two modifications alone or in combination improve the description of the biological scenario.",

The model equations are analyzed for negative, none and normal cooperativity using a specific version of bifurcation theory and they are solved numerically. Special attention is paid to the sign of so-called first Lyapunov value. Interpretations of the results are given, both according to dynamic theory and in biological terms. In terms of cell signaling, we propose the hypothesis that when the outgoing signal of a system spends a physiologically significant amount of time outside of its equilibrium state, then the value of that signal can be sampled at any point along the trajectory towards that equilibrium and indeed, at multiple points. Coupled with non-linear behavior, such as that caused by cooperativity, this feature can account for a complex and varied response, which p53 is known for. From dynamical point of view, we found that when cooperativity is negative, the system has only one stable equilibrium point. In the absence of cooperativity, there is a single unstable equilibrium point with a critical boundary of stability. In the case with normal cooperativity, the system can have one, two, or three steady states with both, bi-stability and bi-instability occurring.",

Here, we model observed, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation and constrain many parameter values based on experimental data. The model's feedback circuit is revised and now includes PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) and ZEITLUPE. The revised model matches data in varying environments and mutants, and gains robustness to parameter variation. Our results suggest that the activation of important morning-expressed genes follows their release from a night inhibitor (NI).

These inclusions contain components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and \u03b1-synuclein confirming that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in protein aggregation. The processes involved are very complex and so we have chosen to take a systems biology approach to examine the system whereby we combine mathematical modelling with experiments in an iterative process. The experiments show that cells are very heterogeneous with respect to inclusion formation and so we use stochastic simulation. The model shows that the variability is partly due to stochastic effects but also depends on protein expression levels of UCH-L1 within cells. The model also indicates that the aggregation process can start even before any proteasome inhibition is present, but that proteasome inhibition greatly accelerates aggregation progression. This leads to less efficient protein degradation and hence more aggregation suggesting that there is a vicious cycle. However, proteasome inhibition may not necessarily be the initiating event. Our combined modelling and experimental approach show that stochastic effects play an important role in the aggregation process and could explain the variability in the age of disease onset. Furthermore, our model provides a valuable tool, as it can be easily modified and extended to incorporate new experimental data, test hypotheses and make testable predictions.",

We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals.

The model accounts for the formation, expression, and propagation of the vitamin K-dependent procoagulant complexes and extends our previous model by including: (a) the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-mediated inactivation of tissue factor (TF).VIIa and its product complexes; (b) the antithrombin-III (AT-III)-mediated inactivation of IIa, mIIa, factor VIIa, factor IXa, and factor Xa; (c) the initial activation of factor V and factor VIII by thrombin generated by factor Xa-membrane; (d) factor VIIIa dissociation\/activity loss; (e) the binding competition and kinetic activation steps that exist between TF and factors VII and VIIa; and (f) the activation of factor VII by IIa, factor Xa, and factor IXa. These additions to our earlier model generate a model consisting of 34 differential equations with 42 rate constants that together describe the 27 independent equilibrium expressions, which describe the fates of 34 species. Simulations are initiated by \"exposing\" picomolar concentrations of TF to an electronic milieu consisting of factors II, IX, X, VII, VIIa, V, and VIIII, and the anticoagulants TFPI and AT-III at concentrations found in normal plasma or associated with coagulation pathology. The reaction followed in terms of thrombin generation, proceeds through phases that can be operationally defined as initiation, propagation, and termination. The generation of thrombin displays a nonlinear dependence upon TF, AT-III, and TFPI and the combination of these latter inhibitors displays kinetic thresholds. At subthreshold TF, thrombin production\/expression is suppressed by the combination of TFPI and AT-III; for concentrations above the TF threshold, the bolus of thrombin produced is quantitatively equivalent. A comparison of the model with empirical laboratory data illustrates that most experimentally observable parameters are captured, and the pathology that results in enhanced or deficient thrombin generation is accurately described.",

Although details of transcription of cyclin genes are known, it is unclear which is the transcriptional cascade that modulates their expression in a timely fashion. Here, we demonstrate that a Clb\/Cdk1-mediated regulation of the Fkh2 transcription factor synchronizes the temporal mitotic CLB expression in budding yeast. A simplified kinetic model of the cyclin\/Cdk network predicts a linear cascade where a Clb\/Cdk1-mediated regulation of an activator molecule drives CLB3 and CLB2 expression. Experimental validation highlights Fkh2 as modulator of CLB3 transcript levels, besides its role in regulating CLB2 expression. A Boolean model based on the minimal number of interactions needed to capture the information flow of the Clb\/Cdk1 network supports the role of an activator molecule in the sequential activation, and oscillatory behavior, of mitotic Clb cyclins. This work illustrates how transcription and phosphorylation networks can be coupled by a Clb\/Cdk1-mediated regulation that synchronizes them.",

Due to absence of specific vaccine or therapy, non-pharmacological interventions including social distancing, contact tracing are essential to end the worldwide COVID-19. We propose a mathematical model that predicts the dynamics of COVID-19 in 17 provinces of India and the overall India. A complete scenario is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the real data or history to date, which in turn divulges the predicted inflection point and ending phase of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed model monitors the dynamics of six compartments, namely susceptible (S), asymptomatic (A), recovered (R), infected (I), isolated infected (Iq ) and quarantined susceptible (Sq ), collectively expressed SARIIqSq . A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the robustness of model predictions to parameter values and the sensitive parameters are estimated from the real data on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our results reveal that achieving a reduction in the contact rate between uninfected and infected individuals by quarantined the susceptible individuals, can effectively reduce the basic reproduction number. Our model simulations demonstrate that the elimination of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is possible by combining the restrictive social distancing and contact tracing. Our predictions are based on real data with reasonable assumptions, whereas the accurate course of epidemic heavily depends on how and when quarantine, isolation and precautionary measures are enforced.",

Disruption of the circadian rhythms manifests to the host's health as metabolic syndromes, including obesity, diabetes, and elevated plasma glucose, eventually leading to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanism behind the relationship between circadian rhythms and metabolism. To start answering this question, we propose a semimechanistic mathematical model to study the effect of circadian disruption on hepatic gluconeogenesis in humans. Our model takes the light-dark cycle and feeding-fasting cycle as two environmental inputs that entrain the metabolic activity in the liver. The model was validated by comparison with data from mice and rat experimental studies. Formal sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were conducted to elaborate on the driving forces for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, simulating the impact of Clock gene knockout suggests that modification to the local pathways tied most closely to the feeding-fasting rhythms may be the most efficient way to restore the disrupted glucose metabolism in liver.",

The use of chimeric antigenic receptor (CAR) T cells to treat B-cell malignancies \u2013leukaemias and lymphomas\u2013is one of the most successful examples, with many patients experiencing long-lasting full responses to this therapy. This treatment works by extract- ing the patient\u2019s T cells and transducing them with the CAR, enabling them to recognize and target cells carrying the antigen CD19 + , which is expressed in these haematological cancers. Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the time response of leukaemias to the injection of CAR T cells. The model accounts for mature and progenitor B-cells, leukaemic cells, CAR T cells and side effects by including the main biological processes involved. The model explains the early post-injection dynamics of the different compart- ments and the fact that the number of CAR T cells injected does not critically affect the treatment outcome. An explicit formula is found that gives the maximum CAR T cell ex- pansion in vivo and the severity of side effects. Our mathematical model captures other known features of the response to this immunotherapy. It also predicts that CD19 + cancer relapses could be the result of competition between leukaemic and CAR T cells, analogous to predator-prey dynamics. We discuss this in the light of the available evidence and the possibility of controlling relapses by early re-challenging of the leukaemia cells with stored CAR T cells.",

In the absence of triggers, the AP exists in a time-invariant resting state (physiological steady state). It is capable of rapid, potent and transient activation response upon challenge with a trigger. Previous models of AP have focused on the activation response. In order to understand the molecular machinery necessary for AP activation and regulation of a physiological steady state, we built parsimonious AP models using experimentally supported kinetic parameters.

In this theoretical study, we derive an ODE model to investigate the interactions between breast cancer tumour cells, an oncolytic virus (Vesicular Stomatitis Virus), and tumour-infiltrating macrophages with different phenotypes which can impact the dynamics of oncolytic viruses. The complexity of the model requires a combined analytical-numerical approach to understand the transient and asymptotic dynamics of this model. We use this model to propose new biological hypotheses regarding the impact on tumour elimination\/relapse\/persistence of: (i) different macrophage polarisation\/re-polarisation rates; (ii) different infection rates of macrophages and tumour cells with the oncolytic virus; (iii) different viral burst sizes for macrophages and tumour cells. We show that increasing the rate at which the oncolytic virus infects the tumour cells can delay tumour relapse and even eliminate tumour. Increasing the rate at which the oncolytic virus particles infect the macrophages can trigger transitions between steady-state dynamics and oscillatory dynamics, but it does not lead to tumour elimination unless the tumour infection rate is also very large. Moreover, we confirm numerically that a large tumour-induced M1\u2192M2 polarisation leads to fast tumour growth and fast relapse (if the tumour was reduced before by a strong anti-tumour immune and viral response). The increase in viral-induced M2\u2192M1 re-polarisation reduces temporarily the tumour size, but does not lead to tumour elimination. Finally, we show numerically that the tumour size is more sensitive to the production of viruses by the infected macrophages.",

The quantitative laws underlying this expansion and subsequent tumour eradication remain unknown. We develop a mathematical model of T cell-tumour cell interactions and demonstrate that expansion can be explained by immune reconstitution dynamics after LD and competition among T cells. CAR T cells rapidly grow and engage tumour cells but experience an emerging growth rate disadvantage compared to normal T cells. Since tumour eradication is deterministically unstable in our model, we define cure as a stochastic event, which, even when likely, can occur at variable times. However, we show that variability in timing is largely determined by patient variability. While cure events impacted by these fluctuations occur early and are narrowly distributed, progression events occur late and are more widely distributed in time. We parameterized our model using population-level CAR T cell and tumour data over time and compare our predictions with progression-free survival rates. We find that therapy could be improved by optimizing the tumour-killing rate and the CAR T cells' ability to adapt, as quantified by their carrying capacity. Our tumour extinction model can be leveraged to examine why therapy works in some patients but not others, and to better understand the interplay of deterministic and stochastic effects on outcomes. For example, our model implies that LD before a second CAR T injection is necessary.",

This model is called the normal-tumor-immune-unhealthy diet model (NTIUNHDM) and governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. In the NTIUNHDM, there are three main populations normal cells, tumor cell and immune cells. The model is discussed analytically and numerically by utilizing a fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method. The dynamic behavior of the NTIUNHDM is discussed by analyzing the stability of the system at various equilibrium points and the Mathematica software is used to simulate the model. From analysis and simulation of the NTIUNHDM, it can be deduced that instability of the response stage, due to a weak immune system, is classified as one of the main reasons for the coexistence of abnormal cells and normal cells. Additionally, it is obvious that the NTIUNHDM has only one stable case when abnormal cells begin progressing into early stages of tumor cells such that the immune cells are generated once.

It has the ability to change architecture by removal of old bone and replacement with newly formed bone in a localized process called remodeling. The model described here is based on the idea that the relative proportions of immature and mature osteoblasts control the degree of osteoclastic activity. In addition, osteoclasts control osteoblasts differentially depending on their stage of differentiation. Despite the tremendous complexity of the bone regulatory system and its fragmentary understanding, we obtain surprisingly good correlations between the model simulations and the experimental observations extracted from the literature. The model results corroborate all behaviors of the bone remodeling system that we have simulated, including the tight coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the catabolic effect induced by continuous administration of PTH, the catabolic action of RANKL, as well as its reversal by soluble antagonist OPG. The model is also able to simulate metabolic bone diseases such as estrogen deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, senescence and glucocorticoid excess. Conversely, possible routes for therapeutic interventions are tested and evaluated. Our model confirms that anti-resorptive therapies are unable to partially restore bone loss, whereas bone formation therapies yield better results. The model enables us to determine and evaluate potential therapies based on their efficacy. In particular, the model predicts that combinations of anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies provide significant benefits compared with monotherapy, especially for certain type of skeletal disease. Finally, the model clearly indicates that increasing the size of the pool of preosteoblasts is an essential ingredient for the therapeutic manipulation of bone formation. This model was conceived as the first step in a bone turnover modeling platform. These initial modeling results are extremely encouraging and lead us to proceed with additional explorations into bone turnover and skeletal remodeling.",

Differential equations describing the fate of each species in the reaction were developed and solved using an interactive procedure based upon the Runge-Kutta technique. In addition to the theoretical considerations involving the reactions of the tissue factor pathway, a physical constraint associated with the stability of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex has been incorporated into the model based upon the empirical observations associated with the stability of this complex. The model system provides a realistic accounting of the fates of each of the proteins in the coagulation reaction through a range of initiator (factor VIIa-tissue factor) concentrations ranging from 5 pM to 5 nM. The model is responsive to alterations in the concentrations of factor VIII, factor V, and their respective activated species, factor VIIIa and factor Va, and overall provides a reasonable approximation of empirical data.

The primary variables of this system are beta-cell mass, plasma insulin concentrations, and plasma glucose concentrations. Existing mathematical models of glucose regulation incorporate only glucose and\/or insulin dynamics. Here we develop a novel model of beta -cell mass, insulin, and glucose dynamics, which consists of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where glucose and insulin dynamics are fast relative to beta-cell mass dynamics. For normal parameter values, the model has two stable fixed points (representing physiological and pathological steady states), separated on a slow manifold by a saddle point. Mild hyperglycemia leads to the growth of the beta -cell mass (negative feedback) while extreme hyperglycemia leads to the reduction of the beta-cell mass (positive feedback). The model predicts that there are three pathways in prolonged hyperglycemia: (1) the physiological fixed point can be shifted to a hyperglycemic level (regulated hyperglycemia), (2) the physiological and saddle points can be eliminated (bifurcation), and (3) progressive defects in glucose and\/or insulin dynamics can drive glucose levels up at a rate faster than the adaptation of the beta -cell mass which can drive glucose levels down (dynamical hyperglycemia).",

        "abstract":"Neurodegeneration is an age-related disorder which is characterised by the accumulation of aggregated protein and neuronal cell death. There are many different neurodegenerative diseases which are classified according to the specific proteins involved and the regions of the brain which are affected. Despite individual differences, there are common mechanisms at the sub-cellular level leading to loss of protein homeostasis. The two central systems in protein homeostasis are the chaperone system, which promotes correct protein folding, and the cellular proteolytic system, which degrades misfolded or damaged proteins. Since these systems and their interactions are very complex, we use mathematical modelling to aid understanding of the processes involved. The model developed in this study focuses on the role of Hsp70 (IPR00103) and Hsp90 (IPR001404) chaperones in preventing both protein aggregation and cell death. Simulations were performed under three different conditions: no stress; transient stress due to an increase in reactive oxygen species; and high stress due to sustained increases in reactive oxygen species. The model predicts that protein homeostasis can be maintained during short periods of stress. However, under long periods of stress, the chaperone system becomes overwhelmed and the probability of cell death pathways being activated increases. Simulations were also run in which cell death mediated by the JNK (P45983) and p38 (Q16539) pathways was inhibited. The model predicts that inhibiting either or both of these pathways may delay cell death but does not stop the aggregation process and that eventually cells die due to aggregated protein inhibiting proteasomal function. This problem can be overcome if the sequestration of aggregated protein into inclusion bodies is enhanced. This model predicts responses to reactive oxygen species-mediated stress that are consistent with currently available experimental data. The model can be used to assess specific interventions to reduce cell death due to impaired protein homeostasis.",

Insulin removal from the blood has been addressed in many studies. The results are highly variable with respect to insulin clearance and the relative contributions of hepatic and renal insulin degradation. RESULTS: We present a dynamic mathematical model of insulin concentration in the blood and of insulin receptor activation in hepatocytes. The model describes renal and hepatic insulin degradation, pancreatic insulin secretion and nonspecific insulin binding in the liver. Hepatic insulin receptor activation by insulin binding, receptor internalization and autophosphorylation is explicitly included in the model. We present a detailed mathematical analysis of insulin degradation and insulin clearance. Stationary model analysis shows that degradation rates, relative contributions of the different tissues to total insulin degradation and insulin clearance highly depend on the insulin concentration. CONCLUSION: This study provides a detailed dynamic model of insulin concentration in the blood and of insulin receptor activation in hepatocytes. Experimental data sets from literature are used for the model validation. We show that essential dynamic and stationary characteristics of insulin degradation are nonlinear and depend on the actual insulin concentration.",

Detailed understanding of the circadian network of higher plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, is hampered by the high number of partially redundant genes. However, the picoeukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri, which was recently shown to possess a small number of non-redundant clock genes, presents an attractive alternative target for detailed modelling of circadian clocks in the green lineage. Based on extensive time-series data from in vivo reporter gene assays, we developed a model of the Ostreococcus clock as a feedback loop between the genes TOC1 and CCA1. The model reproduces the dynamics of the transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. Surprisingly, the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when the light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock circuit, it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions. Systematic screening of the effects of altered day length revealed a complex relationship between phase and photoperiod, which is also captured by the model. The complex light response is shown to stem from circadian gating of light-dependent mechanisms. This study provides insights into the contributions of light inputs to the Ostreococcus clock. The model suggests that a high number of light-dependent reactions are important for flexible timing in a circadian clock with only one feedback loop.",

A comprehensive expression map and full interactome uncovered an unexpectedly simple distribution and structure of this pathway in the shoot apex.

We then tested and confirmed these predictions using a novel auxin signalling sensor that reports input into the signalling pathway, in conjunction with the published DR5 transcriptional output reporter.

Quantitation of the functional consequences of each step in the reaction has allowed for understanding of the presentation of disease in individuals possessing the factor V polymorphism factor VLEIDEN. APC cleavage of membrane-bound bovine factor Va (Arg306, Arg505, Arg662) leads to the dissociation of fragments of the A2 domain, residues 307-713 (A2N.A2C + A2C-peptide), leaving behind the membrane-bound A1.LC species. Evaluation of the dissociation process by light scattering yields invariant mass loss estimates as a function of APC concentration. The rate constant for A2 fragment dissociation varies with [APC], reaching a maximal value of k = 0.028 s-1, the unimolecular rate constant for A2 domain fragment dissociation. The APC binding site resides in the factor Va light chain (LC) (Kd = 7 nM), suggesting that the membrane-bound LC.A1 product would act to sequester APC. This inhibitory interaction (LC.A1.APC) is demonstrated to exist with either purified factor Va LC or the products of factor Va inactivation. Utilizing these experimental data and the reported rates of bond cleavage, binding constants, and product activity values for factor Va partial inactivation products, a model is developed which describes factor Va inactivation and accounts for the defect in factor VLEIDEN. The model accurately predicts the rates of inactivation of factor Va and factor VaLEIDEN, and the effect of product inhibition. Modeled reaction progress diagrams and activity profiles (from either factor Va or factor VaLEIDEN) are coincident with experimentally derived data, providing a mechanistic and kinetic explanation for all steps in the inactivation of normal factor Va and the pathology associated with factor VLEIDEN.",

We propose that the interplay of coagulation inhibitor and blood flow creates threshold behavior. First we test this hypothesis in a minimal, four dimensional model. This model can be analysed by means of time scale analysis. We find indeed that only the interplay of blood flow and inhibition together are able to produce threshold behavior. The mechanism relays on a combination of raw substance supply and wash-out effect by the blood flow and a stabilization of the resting state by the inhibition. We use the insight into this minimal model to interpret the simulation results of a large model. Here, we find that the initiating steps (TF that produces together with fVII(a) factor Xa) does not exhibit threshold behavior, but the overall system does.

If this release is operating near an upper limit, an oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering the blood glucose level than a constant supply.

        "abstract":"A wave of apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs normally in pancreatic beta-cells of newborn mice. We previously showed that macrophages from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice become activated more slowly and engulf apoptotic cells at a lower rate than macrophages from control (Balb\/c) mice. It has been hypothesized that this low clearance could result in secondary necrosis, escalating inflammation and self-antigen presentation that later triggers autoimmune, Type 1 diabetes (T1D). We here investigate whether this hypothesis could offer a reasonable and parsimonious explanation for onset of T1D in NOD mice. We quantify variants of the Copenhagen model (Freiesleben De Blasio et al. 1999 Diabetes 48, 1677), based on parameters from NOD and Balb\/c experimental data. We show that the original Copenhagen model fails to explain observed phenomena within a reasonable range of parameter values, predicting an unrealistic all-or-none disease occurrence for both strains. However, if we take into account that, in general, activated macrophages produce harmful cytokines only when engulfing necrotic (but not apoptotic) cells, then the revised model becomes qualitatively and quantitatively reasonable. Further, we show that known differences between NOD and Balb\/c mouse macrophage kinetics are large enough to account for the fact that an apoptotic wave can trigger escalating inflammatory response in NOD, but not Balb\/c mice. In Balb\/c mice, macrophages clear the apoptotic wave so efficiently, that chronic inflammation is prevented.",

The cause of the ultradian oscillations remains to be elucidated. To determine whether the oscillations could result from the feedback loops between insulin and glucose, a parsimonious mathematical model including the major mechanisms involved in glucose regulation was developed. This model comprises two major negative feedback loops describing the effects of insulin on glucose utilization and glucose production, respectively, and both loops include the stimulatory effect of glucose on insulin secretion. Model formulations and parameters are representative of results from published clinical investigations. The occurrence of sustained insulin and glucose oscillations was found to be dependent on two essential features: 1) a time delay of 30-45 min for the effect of insulin on glucose production and 2) a sluggish effect of insulin on glucose utilization, because insulin acts from a compartment remote from plasma. When these characteristics were incorporated in the model, numerical simulations mimicked all experimental findings so far observed for these ultradian oscillations, including 1) self-sustained oscillations during constant glucose infusion at various rates; 2) damped oscillations after meal or oral glucose ingestion; 3) increased amplitude of oscillation after increased stimulation of insulin secretion, without change in frequency; and 4) slight advance of the glucose oscillation compared with the insulin oscillation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The IP3-calcineurin pathway plays an important role in stimulating the transcription factor NFAT which binds to DNA cooperatively with other hypertrophic transcription factors. Using available kinetic data, we construct a mathematical model of the IP3 signal production system after stimulation by a hypertrophic alpha-adrenergic agonist (endothelin-1) in the mouse atrial cardiac myocyte. We use a global sensitivity analysis to identify key controlling parameters with respect to the resultant IP3 transient, including the phosphorylation of cell-membrane receptors, the ligand strength and binding kinetics to precoupled (with G(alpha)GDP) receptor, and the kinetics associated with precoupling the receptors. We show that the kinetics associated with the receptor system contribute to the behavior of the system to a great extent, with precoupled receptors driving the response to extracellular ligand. Finally, by reparameterizing for a second hypertrophic alpha-adrenergic agonist, angiotensin-II, we show that differences in key receptor kinetic and membrane density parameters are sufficient to explain different observed IP3 transients in essentially the same pathway.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death essential for the maintenance of homeostasis and the removal of potentially damaged cells in multicellular organisms. By binding its cognate membrane receptor, TNF receptor type 1 (TNF-R1), the proinflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) activates pro-apoptotic signaling via caspase activation, but at the same time also stimulates nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-mediated survival pathways. Differential dose-response relationships of these two major TNF signaling pathways have been described experimentally and using mathematical modeling. However, the quantitative analysis of the complex interplay between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways is an open question as it is challenging for several reasons: the overall signaling network is complex, various time scales are present, and cells respond quantitatively and qualitatively in a heterogeneous manner. RESULTS: This study analyzes the complex interplay of the crosstalk of TNF-R1 induced pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways based on an experimentally validated mathematical model. The mathematical model describes the temporal responses on both the single cell level as well as the level of a heterogeneous cell population, as observed in the respective quantitative experiments using TNF-R1 stimuli of different strengths and durations. Global sensitivity of the heterogeneous population was quantified by measuring the average gradient of time of death versus each population parameter. This global sensitivity analysis uncovers the concentrations of Caspase-8 and Caspase-3, and their respective inhibitors BAR and XIAP, as key elements for deciding the cell's fate. A simulated knockout of the NF-\u03baB-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling reveals the importance of this pathway for delaying the time of death, reducing the death rate in the case of pulse stimulation and significantly increasing cell-to-cell variability. CONCLUSIONS: Cell ensemble modeling of a heterogeneous cell population including a global sensitivity analysis presented here allowed us to illuminate the role of the different elements and parameters on apoptotic signaling. The receptors serve to transmit the external stimulus; procaspases and their inhibitors control the switching from life to death, while NF-\u03baB enhances the heterogeneity of the cell population. The global sensitivity analysis of the cell population model further revealed an unexpected impact of heterogeneity, i.e. the reduction of parametric sensitivity.",

        "abstract":"Gravity profoundly influences plant growth and development. Plants respond to changes in orientation by using gravitropic responses to modify their growth. Cholodny and Went hypothesized over 80 years ago that plants bend in response to a gravity stimulus by generating a lateral gradient of a growth regulator at an organ's apex, later found to be auxin. Auxin regulates root growth by targeting Aux\/IAA repressor proteins for degradation. We used an Aux\/IAA-based reporter, domain II (DII)-VENUS, in conjunction with a mathematical model to quantify auxin redistribution following a gravity stimulus. Our multidisciplinary approach revealed that auxin is rapidly redistributed to the lower side of the root within minutes of a 90\u00b0 gravity stimulus. Unexpectedly, auxin asymmetry was rapidly lost as bending root tips reached an angle of 40\u00b0 to the horizontal. We hypothesize roots use a \"tipping point\" mechanism that operates to reverse the asymmetric auxin flow at the midpoint of root bending. These mechanistic insights illustrate the scientific value of developing quantitative reporters such as DII-VENUS in conjunction with parameterized mathematical models to provide high-resolution kinetics of hormone redistribution.",

        "abstract":"Root growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana are sustained by a specialised zone termed the meristem, which contains a population of dividing and differentiating cells that are functionally analogous to a stem cell niche in animals. The hormones auxin and cytokinin control meristem size antagonistically. Local accumulation of auxin promotes cell division and the initiation of a lateral root primordium. By contrast, high cytokinin concentrations disrupt the regular pattern of divisions that characterises lateral root development, and promote differentiation. The way in which the hormones interact is controlled by a genetic regulatory network. In this paper, we propose a deterministic mathematical model to describe this network and present model simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed effects of cytokinin on the expression of auxin regulated genes. We show how auxin response genes and auxin efflux transporters may be affected by the presence of cytokinin. We also analyse and compare the responses of the hormones auxin and cytokinin to changes in their supply with the responses obtained by genetic mutations of SHY2, which encodes a protein that plays a key role in balancing cytokinin and auxin regulation of meristem size. We show that although shy2 mutations can qualitatively reproduce the effect of varying auxin and cytokinin supply on their response genes, some elements of the network respond differently to changes in hormonal supply and to genetic mutations, implying a different, general response of the network. We conclude that an analysis based on the ratio between these two hormones may be misleading and that a mathematical model can serve as a useful tool for stimulate further experimental work by predicting the response of the network to changes in hormone levels and to other genetic mutations.",

        "abstract":"The hormone gibberellin (GA) is a key regulator of plant growth. Many of the components of the gibberellin signal transduction [e.g., GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID1) and DELLA], biosynthesis [e.g., GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox) and GA3ox], and deactivation pathways have been identified. Gibberellin binds its receptor, GID1, to form a complex that mediates the degradation of DELLA proteins. In this way, gibberellin relieves DELLA-dependent growth repression. However, gibberellin regulates expression of GID1, GA20ox, and GA3ox, and there is also evidence that it regulates DELLA expression. In this paper, we use integrated mathematical modeling and experiments to understand how these feedback loops interact to control gibberellin signaling. Model simulations are in good agreement with in vitro data on the signal transduction and biosynthesis pathways and in vivo data on the expression levels of gibberellin-responsive genes. We find that GA-GID1 interactions are characterized by two timescales (because of a lid on GID1 that can open and close slowly relative to GA-GID1 binding and dissociation). Furthermore, the model accurately predicts the response to exogenous gibberellin after a number of chemical and genetic perturbations. Finally, we investigate the role of the various feedback loops in gibberellin signaling. We find that regulation of GA20ox transcription plays a significant role in both modulating the level of endogenous gibberellin and generating overshoots after the removal of exogenous gibberellin. Moreover, although the contribution of other individual feedback loops seems relatively small, GID1 and DELLA transcriptional regulation acts synergistically with GA20ox feedback.",

        "abstract":"Insulin signaling through insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) is important for insulin control of target cells. We have previously demonstrated a rapid and simultaneous overshoot behavior in the phosphorylation dynamics of IR and IRS1 in human adipocytes. Herein, we demonstrate that in murine adipocytes a similar overshoot behavior is not simultaneous for IR and IRS1. The peak of IRS1 phosphorylation, which is a direct consequence of the phosphorylation and the activation of IR, occurs earlier than the peak of IR phosphorylation. We used a conclusive modeling framework to unravel the mechanisms behind this counter-intuitive order of phosphorylation. Through a number of rejections, we demonstrate that two fundamentally different mechanisms may create the reversed order of peaks: (i) two pools of phosphorylated IR, where a large pool of internalized IR peaks late, but phosphorylation of IRS1 is governed by a small plasma membrane-localized pool of IR with an early peak, or (ii) inhibition of the IR-catalyzed phosphorylation of IRS1 by negative feedback. Although (i) may explain the reversed order, this two-pool hypothesis alone requires extensive internalization of IR, which is not supported by experimental data. However, with the additional assumption of limiting concentrations of IRS1, (i) can explain all data. Also, (ii) can explain all available data. Our findings illustrate how modeling can potentiate reasoning, to help draw nontrivial conclusions regarding competing mechanisms in signaling networks. Our work also reveals new differences between human and murine insulin signaling.",

Protein Kinase B (PKB), also known as Akt, participates in the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway, a master regulator of aerobic glycolysis and cellular biosynthesis, two activities shown by both normal and cancer proliferating cells. Not surprisingly considering its relevance for cellular metabolism, Akt\/PKB is often found hyperactive in cancer cells. In the last decade, many efforts have been made to improve the understanding of the control of glucose metabolism and the identification of a therapeutic window between proliferating cancer cells and proliferating normal cells. In this context, we have modeled the link between the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway, glycolysis, lactic acid production, and nucleotide biosynthesis. We used a computational model to compare two metabolic states generated by two different levels of signaling through the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway: one of the two states represents the metabolism of a growing cancer cell characterized by aerobic glycolysis and cellular biosynthesis, while the other state represents the same metabolic network with a reduced glycolytic rate and a higher mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. Biochemical reactions that link glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway revealed their importance for controlling the dynamics of cancer glucose metabolism.",

We used an unprecedented amount of data to parameterise 192 models capturing different hypotheses about molecular mechanisms underlying osmo-adaptation and selected a best approximating model. This model implied novel mechanisms regulating osmo-adaptation in yeast. The model suggested that (i) the main mechanism for osmo-adaptation is a fast and transient non-transcriptional Hog1-mediated activation of glycerol production, (ii) the transcriptional response serves to maintain an increased steady-state glycerol production with low steady-state Hog1 activity, and (iii) fast negative feedbacks of activated Hog1 on upstream signalling branches serves to stabilise adaptation response. The best approximating model also indicated that homoeostatic adaptive systems with two parallel redundant signalling branches show a more robust and faster response than single-branch systems. We corroborated this notion to a large extent by dedicated measurements of volume recovery in single cells. Our study also demonstrates that systematically testing a model ensemble against data has the potential to achieve a better and unbiased understanding of molecular mechanisms.",

However, canonical models of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition cannot explain the scattered spatial distribution of endocrine cells and the cell-type ratio in the developing pancreas. Based on evidence from acinar-to-islet cell transdifferentiation in vitro, we propose that lateral stabilization, i.e. positive feedback between adjacent progenitor cells, acts in parallel with lateral inhibition to regulate pattern formation in the pancreas. A simple mathematical model of transcriptional regulation and cell-cell interaction reveals the existence of multi-stability of spatial patterns whose simultaneous occurrence causes scattering of endocrine cells in the presence of noise. The scattering pattern allows for control of the endocrine-to-exocrine cell-type ratio by modulation of lateral stabilization strength. These theoretical results suggest a previously unrecognized role for lateral stabilization in lineage specification, spatial patterning and cell-type ratio control in organ development.",

The parameters of the model were estimated using experimental results. The simulation results show that the model was able to simulate behavior similar to experimental results.

Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins increases the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha-subunits and are widely regarded as negative regulators of G protein signaling. Using yeast we demonstrate that GTP hydrolysis is not only required for desensitization, but is essential for achieving a high maximal (saturated level) response. Thus RGS-mediated GTP hydrolysis acts as both a negative (low stimulation) and positive (high stimulation) regulator of signaling. To account for this we generated a new kinetic model of the G protein cycle where Galpha(GTP) enters an inactive GTP-bound state following effector activation. Furthermore, in vivo and in silico experimentation demonstrates that maximum signaling output first increases and then decreases with RGS concentration. This unimodal, non-monotone dependence on RGS concentration is novel. Analysis of the kinetic model has revealed a dynamic network motif that shows precisely how inclusion of the inactive GTP-bound state for the Galpha produces this unimodal relationship.",

        "abstract":"Type 2 diabetes originates in an expanding adipose tissue that for unknown reasons becomes insulin resistant. Insulin resistance reflects impairments in insulin signaling, but mechanisms involved are unclear because current research is fragmented. We report a systems level mechanistic understanding of insulin resistance, using systems wide and internally consistent data from human adipocytes. Based on quantitative steady-state and dynamic time course data on signaling intermediaries, normally and in diabetes, we developed a dynamic mathematical model of insulin signaling. The model structure and parameters are identical in the normal and diabetic states of the model, except for three parameters that change in diabetes: (i) reduced concentration of insulin receptor, (ii) reduced concentration of insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4, and (iii) changed feedback from mammalian target of rapamycin in complex with raptor (mTORC1). Modeling reveals that at the core of insulin resistance in human adipocytes is attenuation of a positive feedback from mTORC1 to the insulin receptor substrate-1, which explains reduced sensitivity and signal strength throughout the signaling network. Model simulations with inhibition of mTORC1 are comparable with experimental data on inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin in human adipocytes. We demonstrate the potential of the model for identification of drug targets, e.g. increasing the feedback restores insulin signaling, both at the cellular level and, using a multilevel model, at the whole body level. Our findings suggest that insulin resistance in an expanded adipose tissue results from cell growth restriction to prevent cell necrosis.",

These are the main pathways for cell proliferation and survival. We have developed two mathematical models to relate to the different EGFR signaling in NSCLC and normal cells in the presence or absence of EGFR and PTEN mutations. The dynamics of downstream signaling pathways vary in the disease state and activation of some factors can be indicative of drug resistance. Our simulation denotes the effect of EGFR mutations and increased expression of certain factors in NSCLC EGFR signaling on each of the three pathways where levels of pERK, pSTAT and pAkt are increased. Over activation of ERK, Akt and STAT3 which are the main cell proliferation and survival factors act as promoting factors for tumor progression in NSCLC. In case of loss of PTEN, Akt activity level is considerably increased. Our simulation results show that in the presence of erlotinib, downstream factors i.e. pAkt, pSTAT3 and pERK are inhibited. However, in case of loss of PTEN expression in the presence of erlotinib, pAkt level would not decrease which demonstrates that these cells are resistant to erlotinib.",

The pathway is tightly regulated by multiple feedback loops, exerted by the protein kinase A (PKA) on a few pivotal components of the pathway. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of the second messenger cAMP by performing stochastic simulations and parameter sweep analysis of a mechanistic model of the Ras\/cAMP\/PKA pathway, to determine the effects that the modulation of these feedback mechanisms has on the establishment of stable oscillatory regimes. In particular, we start by studying the role of phosphodiesterases, the enzymes that catalyze the degradation of cAMP, which represent the major negative feedback in this pathway. Then, we show the results on cAMP oscillations when perturbing the amount of protein Cdc25 coupled with the alteration of the intracellular ratio of the guanine nucleotides (GTP\/GDP), which are known to regulate the switch of the GTPase Ras protein. This multi-level regulation of the amplitude and frequency of oscillations in the Ras\/cAMP\/PKA pathway might act as a fine tuning mechanism for the downstream targets of PKA, as also recently evidenced by some experimental investigations on the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the transcription factor Msn2 in yeast cells.",

However, the effects of such interactions on signal transduction and their physiological relevance have been largely undetermined. Ligand-bound GPCRs initiate by promoting exchange of GDP for GTP on the G\u03b1 subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Signaling is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP to GDP through intrinsic GTPase activity of the G\u03b1 subunit, a reaction catalyzed by RGS proteins. Using yeast as a tool to study GPCR signaling in isolation, we define an interaction between the cognate GPCR (Mam2) and RGS (Rgs1), mapping the interaction domains. This reaction tethers Rgs1 at the plasma membrane and is essential for physiological signaling response. In vivo quantitative data inform the development of a kinetic model of the GTPase cycle, which extends previous attempts by including GPCR-RGS interactions. In vivo and in silico data confirm that GPCR-RGS interactions can impose an additional layer of regulation through mediating RGS subcellular localization to compartmentalize RGS activity within a cell, thus highlighting their importance as potential targets to modulate GPCR signaling pathways.",

The chemical master equation provides a fundamental framework for studying these networks, and the time-varying landscape probability distribution over the full microstates, i.e., the combination of copy numbers of molecular species, provide a full characterization of the network dynamics. A complete characterization of the space of the microstates is a prerequisite for obtaining the full landscape probability distribution of a network. However, there are neither closed-form solutions nor algorithms fully describing all microstates for a given molecular network.We have developed an algorithm that can exhaustively enumerate the microstates of a molecular network of small copy numbers under the condition that the net gain in newly synthesized molecules is smaller than a predefined limit. We also describe a simple method for computing the exact mean or steady state landscape probability distribution over microstates. We show how the full landscape probability for the gene networks of the self-regulating gene and the toggle-switch in the steady state can be fully characterized. We also give an example using the MAPK cascade network. Data and server will be available at URL: http:\/\/scsb.sjtu.edu.cn\/statespace.Our algorithm works for networks of small copy numbers buffered with a finite copy number of net molecules that can be synthesized, regardless of the reaction stoichiometry, and is optimal in both storage and time complexity. The algorithm can also be used to calculate the rates of all transitions between microstates from given reactions and reaction rates. The buffer size is limited by the available memory or disk storage. Our algorithm is applicable to a class of biological networks when the copy numbers of molecules are small and the network is closed, or the network is open but the net gain in newly synthesized molecules does not exceed a predefined buffer capacity. For these networks, our method allows full stochastic characterization of the mean landscape probability distribution, and the steady state when it exists.",

        "abstract":"Critical events that occur rarely in biological processes are of great importance, but are challenging to study using Monte Carlo simulation. By introducing biases to reaction selection and reaction rates, weighted stochastic simulation algorithms based on importance sampling allow rare events to be sampled more effectively. However, existing methods do not address the important issue of barrier crossing, which often arises from multistable networks and systems with complex probability landscape. In addition, the proliferation of parameters and the associated computing cost pose significant problems. Here we introduce a general theoretical framework for obtaining optimized biases in sampling individual reactions for estimating probabilities of rare events. We further describe a practical algorithm called adaptively biased sequential importance sampling (ABSIS) method for efficient probability estimation. By adopting a look-ahead strategy and by enumerating short paths from the current state, we estimate the reaction-specific and state-specific forward and backward moving probabilities of the system, which are then used to bias reaction selections. The ABSIS algorithm can automatically detect barrier-crossing regions, and can adjust bias adaptively at different steps of the sampling process, with bias determined by the outcome of exhaustively generated short paths. In addition, there are only two bias parameters to be determined, regardless of the number of the reactions and the complexity of the network. We have applied the ABSIS method to four biochemical networks: the birth-death process, the reversible isomerization, the bistable Schlo\u0308gl model, and the enzymatic futile cycle model. For comparison, we have also applied the finite buffer discrete chemical master equation (dCME) method recently developed to obtain exact numerical solutions of the underlying discrete chemical master equations of these problems. This allows us to assess sampling results objectively by comparing simulation results with true answers. Overall, ABSIS can accurately and efficiently estimate rare event probabilities for all examples, often with smaller variance than other importance sampling algorithms.

        "abstract":"Critical events that occur rarely in biological processes are of great importance, but are challenging to study using Monte Carlo simulation. By introducing biases to reaction selection and reaction rates, weighted stochastic simulation algorithms based on importance sampling allow rare events to be sampled more effectively. However, existing methods do not address the important issue of barrier crossing, which often arises from multistable networks and systems with complex probability landscape. In addition, the proliferation of parameters and the associated computing cost pose significant problems. Here we introduce a general theoretical framework for obtaining optimized biases in sampling individual reactions for estimating probabilities of rare events. We further describe a practical algorithm called adaptively biased sequential importance sampling (ABSIS) method for efficient probability estimation. By adopting a look-ahead strategy and by enumerating short paths from the current state, we estimate the reaction-specific and state-specific forward and backward moving probabilities of the system, which are then used to bias reaction selections. The ABSIS algorithm can automatically detect barrier-crossing regions, and can adjust bias adaptively at different steps of the sampling process, with bias determined by the outcome of exhaustively generated short paths. In addition, there are only two bias parameters to be determined, regardless of the number of the reactions and the complexity of the network. We have applied the ABSIS method to four biochemical networks: the birth-death process, the reversible isomerization, the bistable Schlo\u0308gl model, and the enzymatic futile cycle model. For comparison, we have also applied the finite buffer discrete chemical master equation (dCME) method recently developed to obtain exact numerical solutions of the underlying discrete chemical master equations of these problems. This allows us to assess sampling results objectively by comparing simulation results with true answers. Overall, ABSIS can accurately and efficiently estimate rare event probabilities for all examples, often with smaller variance than other importance sampling algorithms. The ABSIS method is general and can be applied to study rare events of other stochastic networks with complex probability landscape.",

Development of new therapies to treat and prevent preterm labour is seriously hampered by incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that initiate labour at term and preterm. Computational modelling provides a new opportunity to improve this understanding. It is a useful tool in (i) identifying gaps in knowledge and informing future research, and (ii) providing the basis for an in silico model of parturition in which novel drugs to prevent or treat preterm labour can be \"tested\". Despite their merits, computational models are rarely used to study the molecular events initiating labour. Here, we present the first attempt to generate a dynamic kinetic model that has relevance to the molecular mechanisms of preterm labour. Using published data, we model an important candidate signalling pathway in infection-induced preterm labour: that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced activation of Nuclear Factor kappa B. This is the first model of this pathway to explicitly include molecular interactions upstream of Nuclear Factor kappa B activation. We produced a formalised graphical depiction of the pathway and built a kinetic model based on ordinary differential equations. The kinetic model accurately reproduced published in vitro time course plots of Lipopolysaccharide-induced Nuclear Factor kappa B activation in mouse embryo fibroblasts. In this preliminary work we have provided proof of concept that it is possible to build computational models of signalling pathways that are relevant to the regulation of labour, and suggest that models that are validated with wet-lab experiments have the potential to greatly benefit the field.",

In this paper we address this issue by mathematical modeling. We present a model for a genetic switch determining the cell fate of progenitor cells which can differentiate into osteoblasts (bone cells) or chondrocytes (cartilage cells). The model consists of two switch mechanisms and reproduces the experimentally observed three stable equilibrium states: a progenitor, an osteogenic, and a chondrogenic state. Conventionally, the loss of an intermediate (progenitor) state and the entailed attraction to one of two opposite (differentiated) states is modeled as a result of changing parameters. In our model in contrast, we achieve this by distributing the differentiation process to two functional switch parts acting in concert: one triggering differentiation and the other determining cell fate. Via stability and bifurcation analysis, we investigate the effects of biochemical stimuli associated with different system inputs. We employ our model to generate differentiation scenarios on the single cell as well as on the cell population level. The single cell scenarios allow to reconstruct the switching upon extrinsic signals, whereas the cell population scenarios provide a framework to identify the impact of intrinsic properties and the limiting factors for successful differentiation.",

While the threshold is remarkably robust, a more sophisticated model predicted that it could be modulated as a function of EGFR levels on the cell surface. We confirmed experimentally that the system has evolved to perform optimally at physiological levels of EGFR. As a consequence, this system displays an intrinsic weakness that causes--at the supraphysiological levels of receptor and\/or ligand associated with cancer--uncoupling of the mechanisms leading to signalling through phosphorylation and attenuation through ubiquitination.",

Innate immunity is represented by interferon-induced resistance to infection of respiratory epithelial cells and by removal of infected cells by effector cells (cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells). Adaptive immunity is represented by virus-specific antibodies. Similar in spirit to the recent model of Bocharov and Romanyukha [1994. Mathematical model of antiviral immune response. III. Influenza A virus infection. J. Theor. Biol. 167, 323-360], the model is constructed as a system of 10 ordinary differential equations with 27 parameters characterizing the rates of various processes contributing to the course of disease. The parameters are derived from published experimental data or estimated so as to reproduce available data about the time course of IAV infection in a na\u00efve host. We explore the effect of initial viral load on the severity and duration of the disease, construct a phase diagram that sheds insight into the dynamics of the disease, and perform sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to explore which ones influence the most the onset, duration and severity of infection. To account for the variability and speed of adaptation of the adaptive response to a particular virus strain, we introduce a variable that quantifies the antigenic compatibility between the virus and the antibodies currently produced by the organism. We find that for small initial viral load the disease progresses through an asymptomatic course, for intermediate value it takes a typical course with constant duration and severity of infection but variable onset, and for large initial viral load the disease becomes severe. This behavior is robust to a wide range of parameter values. The absence of antibody response leads to recurrence of disease and appearance of a chronic state with nontrivial constant viral load.",

The aim of the present study was to develop a small-scale mathematical model based on easily attainable experimental data to explain differences in influenza kinetics induced by different virus strains in mice. To develop a three-dimensional ordinary differential equation model of influenza dynamics, the following variables were included: (i) viral pathogenicity (P), (ii) antiviral immune defense (D), and (iii) inflammation due to pro-inflammatory response (I). Influenza virus-induced symptoms (clinical score S) in mice provided the basis for calculations of P and I. Both, mono- and biphasic course of mild to severe influenza induced by three clinical A(H1N1)pdm09 strains and one European swine H1N2 virus were comparatively and quantitatively studied by fitting the mathematical model to the experimental data. The model hypothesizes reasons for mild and severe influenza with mono- as well as biphasic course of disease. According to modeling results, the second peak of the biphasic course of infection is caused by inflammation. The parameters (i) maximum primary pathogenicity, (ii) viral infection rate, and (iii) rate of activation of the immune system represent most important parameters that quantitatively characterize the different pattern of virus-specific influenza kinetics.",

Unusually, the branch of infected solutions that connects the uninfected branch and the pure infection branch can be found analytically and always includes a limit point, subject to a few conditions on the parameters. When the action of stem cells is included, the bifurcation between the pure infection and infected branches unfolds, leaving a single branch of infected solutions.

In turn, E2F is inhibited by miR449 through regulating different transcripts, thus forming negative feedback loops in the interaction network. Here, based on the integration of experimental evidence and quantitative data, we studied Rb-E2F pathway coupling the positive feedback loops and negative feedback loops mediated by miR449. Therefore, a mathematical model is constructed based in part on the model proposed in Yao-Lee et al. (2008) and nonlinear dynamical behaviors including the stability and bifurcations of the model are discussed. A comparison is given to reveal the implication of the fundamental differences of Rb-E2F pathway between regulation and deregulation of miR449. Coherent with the experiments it predicts that miR449 plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle progression and provides a twofold safety mechanism to avoid excessive E2F-induced proliferation by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis shows that the mechanisms of the negative regulation of miR449 to three different transcripts are quite distinctive which needs to be verified experimentally. This study may help us to analyze the whole cell cycle process mediated by other miRNAs more easily. A better knowledge of the dynamical behaviors of miRNAs mediated networks is also of interest for bio-engineering and artificial control.",

        "abstract":"Until recently many studies of bone remodeling at the cellular level have focused on the behavior of mature osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and their respective precursor cells, with the role of osteocytes and bone lining cells left largely unexplored. This is particularly true with respect to the mathematical modeling of bone remodeling. However, there is increasing evidence that osteocytes play important roles in the cycle of targeted bone remodeling, in serving as a significant source of RANKL to support osteoclastogenesis, and in secreting the bone formation inhibitor sclerostin. Moreover, there is also increasing interest in sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted bone formation inhibitor, and its role in regulating local response to changes in the bone microenvironment. Here we develop a cell population model of bone remodeling that includes the role of osteocytes, sclerostin, and allows for the possibility of RANKL expression by osteocyte cell populations. We have aimed to give a simple, yet still tractable, model that remains faithful to the underlying system based on the known literature. This model extends and complements many of the existing mathematical models for bone remodeling, but can be used to explore aspects of the process of bone remodeling that were previously beyond the scope of prior modeling work. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate that our model can be used to explore theoretically many of the qualitative features of the role of osteocytes in bone biology as presented in recent literature.",

        "abstract":"Several studies suggest that one possible cause of impaired wound healing is failed or insufficient lymphangiogenesis, that is the formation of new lymphatic capillaries. Although many mathematical models have been developed to describe the formation of blood capillaries (angiogenesis) very few have been proposed for the regeneration of the lymphatic network. Moreover, lymphangiogenesis is markedly distinct from angiogenesis, occurring at different times and in a different manner. Here a model of five ordinary differential equations is presented to describe the formation of lymphatic capillaries following a skin wound. The variables represent different cell densities and growth factor concentrations, and where possible the parameters are estimated from experimental and clinical data. The system is then solved numerically and the results are compared with the available biological literature. Finally, a parameter sensitivity analysis of the model is taken as a starting point for suggesting new therapeutic approaches targeting the enhancement of lymphangiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The work provides a deeper understanding of the phenomenon in question, clarifying the main factors involved. In particular, the balance between TGF-\u03b2 and VEGF levels, rather than their absolute values, is identified as crucial to effective lymphangiogenesis. In addition, the results indicate lowering the macrophage-mediated activation of TGF-\u03b2 and increasing the basal lymphatic endothelial cell growth rate, inter alia, as potential treatments. It is hoped the findings of this paper may be considered in the development of future experiments investigating novel lymphangiogenic therapies.",

From 1950 to 2015, 130,494 human rabies cases were reported in Mainland China with an average of 1977 cases per year. It is estimated that 95% of these human rabies cases are due to dog bites. The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained recently on studying the transmission of rabies in China. We first construct a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and use the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010. Then we modify the basic model by including both domestic and stray dogs and apply the model to simulate the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. To study the seasonality of rabies, in Section\u00a04 we further propose a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates and employ the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010. To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Section\u00a05 we add diffusion to the dog population in the basic SEIR model to obtain a reaction-diffusion equation model and determine the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium. Finally, in order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Section\u00a06 we propose a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and use the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively. Some discussions are provided in Section\u00a07.",

The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by reversible phosphorylation, Cdk inhibitors, and protein synthesis or degradation. Growth factors (GFs) trigger the transition from a quiescent, stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. These oscillations correspond to the repetitive, transient activation of cyclin D\/Cdk4-6 in G(1), cyclin E\/Cdk2 at the G(1)\/S transition, cyclin A\/Cdk2 in S and at the S\/G(2) transition, and cyclin B\/Cdk1 at the G(2)\/M transition. The model accounts for the following major properties of the mammalian cell cycle: (i) repetitive cell cycling in the presence of suprathreshold amounts of GF; (ii) control of cell-cycle progression by the balance between antagonistic effects of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the transcription factor E2F; and (iii) existence of a restriction point in G(1), beyond which completion of the cell cycle becomes independent of GF. The model also accounts for endoreplication. Incorporating the DNA replication checkpoint mediated by kinases ATR and Chk1 slows down the dynamics of the cell cycle without altering its oscillatory nature and leads to better separation of the S and M phases. The model for the mammalian cell cycle shows how the regulatory structure of the Cdk network results in its temporal self-organization, leading to the repetitive, sequential activation of the four Cdk modules that brings about the orderly progression along cell-cycle phases.",

We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.",

The hormone hepcidin regulates the export of iron from tissues to the plasma contributing to iron homeostasis and also restricting its availability to infectious agents. Disruption of iron regulation in mammals leads to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and contributes to the etiology of several other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that hepcidin alone is able to regulate iron distribution in different dietary regimes in the mouse using a computational model of iron distribution calibrated with radioiron tracer data.A model was developed and calibrated to the data from adequate iron diet, which was able to simulate the iron distribution under a low iron diet. However simulation of high iron diet shows considerable deviations from the experimental data. Namely the model predicts more iron in red blood cells and less iron in the liver than what was observed in experiments.These results suggest that hepcidin alone is not sufficient to regulate iron homeostasis in high iron conditions and that other factors are important. The model was able to simulate anemia when hepcidin was increased but was unable to simulate hemochromatosis when hepcidin was suppressed, suggesting that in high iron conditions additional regulatory interactions are important.",

Comparisons were made in extrinsically triggered human citrated plasma, for which endogenous thrombin potential and clot formation were simultaneously measured with a Wallac multilabel counter equipped with both fluorometric and photometric detectors and a fluorogenic reporter substrate. The results demonstrated stronger inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential by argatroban than by DX-9065a, especially when coagulation was initiated at higher tissue factor concentrations, while argatroban appeared to be slightly less potent in its ability to prolong clot time.

The present work is a first attempt to model the neurobiological aspect of cancer development through a system of differential equations. The model confirms the experimental observations that a tumour is able to promote nerve formation\/elongation around itself, and that high levels of nerve growth factor and axon guidance molecules are recorded in the presence of a tumour. Our results also reflect the observation that high stress levels (represented by higher norepinephrine release by sympathetic nerves) contribute to tumour development and spread, indicating a mutually beneficial relationship between tumour cells and neurons.

These models, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving individual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common characteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do the outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the other?

These models, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving individual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common characteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do the outcomes differ?

We found that neither CD4(+) Th1 nor CD4(+) Th2 cells could eliminate the cancer cells when acting alone, but that tumor elimination could be induced by recruitment of eosinophils by the Th2 cells. These recruited eosinophils had unexpected indirect effects on the decay rate of type 2 cytokines and the rate at which Th2 cells are inactivated through interactions with cancer cells. Strikingly, the presence of eosinophils impacted tumor growth more significantly than the release of tumor-suppressing cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.

Chemotherapy protocol design is considered in this context using a simple, robust, model of advanced tumour growth with Gompertzian dynamics, taking into account the effects of drug resistance. It is predicted that reduced chemotherapy protocols can readily lead to improved survival times due to the effects of competition between resistant and sensitive tumour cells.

In contrast, CD4+ T cells are commonly classified as helper T cells (HTCs) on the basis of their roles in providing help to the generation and maintenance of effective CD8+ cytotoxic and memory T cells. In order to get a better insight on the role of HTCs in a tumor immune system, we incorporate the third population of HTCs into a previous two dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) model. Further we introduce the adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACI) as the treatment to boost the immune system to fight against tumors. Compared tumor cells (TCs) and effector cells (ECs), the recruitment of HTCs changes the dynamics of the system substantially, by the effects through particular parameters, i.e., the activation rate of ECs by HTCs, \u03c0 (scaled as \u03c0), and the HTCs stimulation rate by the presence of identified tumor antigens, k2 (scaled as \u03c52). We describe the stability regions of the interior equilibria \u00c9 (no treatment case) and E+ (treatment case) in the scaled (\u03c0,\u03c52) parameter space respectively. Both \u03c0 and \u03c52 can destabilize \u00c9 and E+ and cause Hopf bifurcations.

They also show that TCs may be eradicated from the patient's body under the ACI treatment.",

Cancer must grow in a primary site, extravasate and survive in the circulation to then intravasate into target organ (invasive species survival in transport). Cancer cells often lay dormant at their metastatic site for a long period of time (lag period for invasive species) before proliferating (invasive spread). Proliferation in the new site has an impact on the target organ microenvironment (ecological impact) and eventually the human host (biosphere impact).Tilman has described mathematical equations for the competition between invasive species in a structured habitat. These equations were adapted to study the invasion of cancer cells into the bone marrow microenvironment as a structured habitat. A large proportion of solid tumor metastases are bone metastases, known to usurp hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) homing pathways to establish footholds in the bone marrow. This required accounting for the fact that this is the natural home of hematopoietic stem cells and that they already occupy this structured space. The adapted Tilman model of invasion dynamics is especially valuable for modeling the lag period or dormancy of cancer cells.The Tilman equations for modeling the invasion of two species into a defined space have been modified to study the invasion of cancer cells into the bone marrow microenvironment. These modified equations allow a more flexible way to model the space competition between the two cell species. The ability to model initial density, metastatic seeding into the bone marrow and growth once the cells are present, and movement of cells out of the bone marrow niche and apoptosis of cells are all aspects of the adapted equations. These equations are currently being applied to clinical data sets for verification and further refinement of the models.",

During divisions, offspring cells acquire variations, which can be either normal or abnormal. If an abnormal variation is present in more than 25% of the final cells, a monoclonal, leukemic pattern occurs. Such a pattern develops if: (A1) The abnormal variation occurs early, during the first or second divisions; (A2) The variation confers exceptional proliferative capacity; (B) A sizable proportion of the normal clones are destroyed and a previously non-significant abnormal clone gains relative dominance over a depleted environment; (C) The abnormal variation confers relative immortality, rendering it significant during the contraction phase.

In this article, we consider a mathematical approach to investigate the possible outcomes of the complex interactions between two extreme types of macrophages (M1 and M2 cells), effector [Formula: see text] T cells and an oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), on the growth\/elimination of B16F10 melanoma. We discuss, in terms of VSV, [Formula: see text] and macrophages levels, two different types of immune responses which could ensure tumour control and eventual elimination. We show that both innate and adaptive anti-tumour immune responses, as well as the oncolytic virus, could be very important in delaying tumour relapse and eventually eliminating the tumour. Overall this study supports the use mathematical modelling to increase our understanding of the complex immune interaction following oncolytic virotherapies.

Into this work, we propose a mathematical model for cancer onset and development, considering three populations: normal, premalignant and cancer cells. The model takes into account three hallmarks of cancer: self-sufficiency on growth signals, insensibility to anti-growth signals and evading apoptosis. By using a nonlinear expression to describe the mutation from premalignant to cancer cells, the model includes genetic instability as an enabling characteristic of tumour progression. Mathematical analysis was performed in detail. Results indicate that apoptosis and tissue repair system are the first barriers against tumour progression. One of these mechanisms must be corrupted for cancer to develop from a single mutant cell. The results also show that the presence of aggressive cancer cells opens way to survival of less adapted premalignant cells. Numerical simulations were performed with parameter values based on experimental data of breast cancer, and the necessary time taken for cancer to reach a detectable size from a single mutant cell was estimated with respect to some parameters. We find that the rates of apoptosis and mutations have a large influence on the pace of tumour progression and on the time it takes to become clinically detectable.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:In recent decades, cancer has become one of the most fatal and destructive diseases which is threatening humans life. Accordingly, different types of cancer treatment are studied with the main aim to have the best treatment with minimum side effects. Anti-angiogenic is a molecular targeted therapy which can be coupled with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although this method does not eliminate the whole tumor, but it can keep the tumor size in a given state by preventing the formation of new blood vessels. In this paper, a novel model-free method based on reinforcement learning (RL) framework is used to design a closed-loop control of anti-angiogenic drug dosing administration. METHODS:A Q-learning algorithm is developed for the drug dosing closed-loop control. This controller is designed using two different values of the maximum drug dosage to reduce the tumor volume up to a desired value. The mathematical model of tumor growth under anti-angiogenic inhibitor is used to simulate a real patient. RESULTS:The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown through in silico simulation and its robustness to patient parameters variation is demonstrated. It is demonstrated that the tumor reaches its minimal volume in 84 days with maximum drug inlet of 30 mg\/kg\/day. Also, it is shown that the designed controller is robust with respect to \u202f\u00b1\u202f20% of tumor growth parameters changes. CONCLUSION:The proposed closed-loop reinforcement learning-based controller for cancer treatment using anti-angiogenic inhibitor provides an effective and novel result such that with a clinically valid and safe dosage of drug, the volume reduces up to 1mm3 in a reasonable short period compared to the literature.",

Consisting of the major kinase complexes mTOR Complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1\/2), the mTOR network harbours complex interactions and feedback loops. The DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) was recently identified as an endogenous inhibitor of both mTORC1 and 2 through direct interactions, and is in turn degraded by mTORC1\/2, adding an extra layer of complexity to the mTOR network. Yet, the dynamic properties of the DEPTOR-mTOR network and the roles of DEPTOR in coordinating mTORC1\/2 activation dynamics have not been characterised. Using computational modelling, systems analysis and dynamic simulations we show that DEPTOR confers remarkably rich and complex dynamic behaviours to mTOR signalling, including abrupt, bistable switches, oscillations and co-existing bistable\/oscillatory responses. Transitions between these distinct modes of behaviour are enabled by modulating DEPTOR expression alone. We characterise the governing conditions for the observed dynamics by elucidating the network in its vast multi-dimensional parameter space, and develop strategies to identify core network design motifs underlying these dynamics. Our findings provide new systems-level insights into the complexity of mTOR signalling contributed by DEPTOR.",

T cell receptor diversity, or the extent of pathogen-derived antigen responsiveness of the T cell pool, is known to diminish with age, but inherent experimental difficulties preclude accurate analysis on the full organismal level. In this paper, we formulate a mechanistic mathematical model of T cell population dynamics on the immunoclonal subpopulation level, which provides quantitative estimates of diversity. We define different estimates for diversity that depend on the individual number of cells in a specific immunoclone.

One of the mechanisms conferring gefitinib resistance to lung adenocarcinoma is the amplification of the MET gene, which is observed in 5-22% of gefitinib-resistant tumors. A previous study suggested that MET amplification could cause gefitinib resistance by driving ErbB3-dependent activation of the PI3K pathway. In this study, we built a mathematical model of gefitinib resistance caused by MET amplification using lung adenocarcinoma HCC827-GR (gefitinib resistant) cells. The molecular reactions involved in gefitinib resistance consisted of dimerization and phosphorylation of three molecules, EGFR, ErbB3, and MET were described by a series of ordinary differential equations. To perform a computer simulation, we quantified each molecule on the cell surface using flow cytometry and estimated unknown parameters by dimensional analysis. Our simulation showed that the number of active ErbB3 molecules is around a hundred-fold smaller than that of active MET molecules. Limited contribution of ErbB3 in gefitinib resistance by MET amplification is also demonstrated using HCC827-GR cells in culture experiments. Our mathematical model provides a quantitative understanding of the molecular reactions underlying drug resistance.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: In this paper we propose a model reduction method for biochemical reaction networks governed by a variety of reversible and irreversible enzyme kinetic rate laws, including reversible Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics. The method proceeds by a stepwise reduction in the number of complexes, defined as the left and right-hand sides of the reactions in the network. It is based on the Kron reduction of the weighted Laplacian matrix, which describes the graph structure of the complexes and reactions in the network. It does not rely on prior knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of the network and hence can be automated, as we demonstrate. The reduced network has fewer complexes, reactions, variables and parameters as compared to the original network, and yet the behaviour of a preselected set of significant metabolites in the reduced network resembles that of the original network. Moreover the reduced network largely retains the structure and kinetics of the original model. RESULTS: We apply our method to a yeast glycolysis model and a rat liver fatty acid beta-oxidation model. When the number of state variables in the yeast model is reduced from 12 to 7, the difference between metabolite concentrations in the reduced and the full model, averaged over time and species, is only 8%. Likewise, when the number of state variables in the rat-liver beta-oxidation model is reduced from 42 to 29, the difference between the reduced model and the full model is 7.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The method has improved our understanding of the dynamics of the two networks. We found that, contrary to the general disposition, the first few metabolites which were deleted from the network during our stepwise reduction approach, are not those with the shortest convergence times. It shows that our reduction approach performs differently from other approaches that are based on time-scale separation. The method can be used to facilitate fitting of the parameters or to embed a detailed model of interest in a more coarse-grained yet realistic environment.",

However, the ability to predict the patient's benefit from these therapeutics remains an unmet clinical need. Mathematical models that predict melanoma patients' response to ICI can contribute to better informed clinical decisions. Here, we developed a simple mathematical population model for pembrolizumab-treated advanced melanoma patients, and analyzed the local and global dynamics of the system. Our results show that zero, one, or two steady states of the mathematical system exist in the phase plane, depending on the parameter values of individual patients. Without treatment, the simulated tumors grew uncontrollably. At increased efficacy of the immune system, e.g., due to immunotherapy, two steady states were found, one leading to uncontrollable tumor growth, and the other resulting in tumor size stabilization. Model analysis indicates that a sufficient increase in the activation of CD8+ T cells results in stable disease, whereas a significant reduction in T-cell exhaustion, another process contributing CD8+ T cell activity, temporarily reduces the tumor mass, but fails to control disease progression in the long run. Importantly, the initial tumor burden influences the response to treatment: small tumors respond better to treatment than larger tumors. In conclusion, our model suggests that disease progression and response to ICI depend on the ratio between activation and exhaustion rates of CD8+ T cells. The analysis of the model provides a foundation for the use of computational methods to personalize immunotherapy.",

However, viruses of microbes can also initiate chronic infections, in which new viruses particles are released via budding and without cell lysis. In chronic infections, viral genomes may also be passed on from mother to daughter cells during division. The consequences of chronic infections for the population dynamics of viruses and microbes remains under-explored. In this paper we present a model of chronic infections as well as a model of interactions between lytic and chronic viruses competing for the same microbial population. In the chronic only model, we identify conditions underlying complex bifurcations such as saddle-node, backward and Hopfbifurcations, leading to parameter regions with multiple attractors and\/or oscillatory behavior. We then utilize invasion analysis to examine the coupled nonlinear system of microbes, lytic viruses, and chronic viruses. In so doing we find unexpected results, including a regime in which the chronic virus requires the lytic virus for survival, invasion, and persistence. In this regime, lytic viruses decrease total cell densities, so that a subpopulation of chronically infected cells experience decreased niche competition. As such, even when chronically infected cells have a growth disadvantage, lytic viruses can, paradoxically, enable the proliferation of both chronically infected cells and chronic viruses.

Using a Gompertz growth law, we discuss a model that captures the in vivo dynamics of a cancer under treatment with an oncolytic virus. With the aid of local stability analysis and bifurcation plots, the typical interactions between virus and tumour are investigated. The system shows a singular equilibrium and a number of nonlinear behaviours that have interesting biological consequences, such as long-period oscillations and bistable states where two different outcomes can occur depending on the initial conditions. Complete tumour eradication appears to be possible only for parameter combinations where viral characteristics match well with the tumour growth rate. Interestingly, the model shows that therapies with a high initial injection or involving a highly effective virus do not universally result in successful strategies for eradication. Further, the use of additional, \"boosting\" injection schedules does not always lead to complete eradication. Our framework, instead, suggests that low viral loads can be in some cases more effective than high loads, and that a less resilient virus can help avoid high amplitude oscillations between tumours and virus. Finally, the model points to a number of interesting findings regarding the role of oscillations and bistable states between a tumour and an oncolytic virus. Strategies for the elimination of such fluctuations depend strongly on the initial viral load and the combination of parameters describing the features of the tumour and virus.",

        "abstract":"Akt\/PKB is a biochemical regulator that functions as an important cross-talk node between several signalling pathways in the mammalian cell. In particular, Akt is a key mediator of glucose transport in response to insulin. The phosphorylation (activation) of only a small percentage of the Akt pool of insulin-sensitive cells results in maximal translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (PM). This enables the diffusion of glucose into the cell. The dysregulation of Akt signalling is associated with the development of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Akt is synthesised in the cytoplasm in the inactive state. Under the influence of insulin, it moves to the PM, where it is phosphorylated to form pAkt. Although phosphorylation occurs only at the PM, pAkt is found in many cellular locations, including the PM, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus. Indeed, the spatial distribution of pAkt within the cell appears to be an important determinant of downstream regulation. Here we present a simple, linear, four-compartment ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of Akt activation that tracks both the biochemical state and the physical location of Akt. This model embodies the main features of the activation of this important cross-talk node and is consistent with the experimental data. In particular, it allows different downstream signalling motifs without invoking separate feedback pathways. Moreover, the model is computationally tractable, readily analysed, and elucidates some of the apparent anomalies in insulin signalling via Akt.",

The specific contributions of individual feedback regulators, however, remain unclear. Based on extensive time-resolved data sets in primary erythroid progenitor cells, we established a dynamic pathway model to dissect the roles of the two transcriptional negative feedback regulators of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, CIS and SOCS3, in JAK2\/STAT5 signaling. Facilitated by the model, we calculated the STAT5 response for experimentally unobservable Epo concentrations and provide a quantitative link between cell survival and the integrated response of STAT5 in the nucleus. Model predictions show that the two feedbacks CIS and SOCS3 are most effective at different ligand concentration ranges due to their distinct inhibitory mechanisms. This divided function of dual feedback regulation enables control of STAT5 responses for Epo concentrations that can vary 1000-fold in vivo. Our modeling approach reveals dose-dependent feedback control as key property to regulate STAT5-mediated survival decisions over a broad range of ligand concentrations.",

This is particularly true in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, an indolent neoplastic disease of B-lymphocytes which eventually causes the immune system's failure. In this and other areas of cancer research, mathematical modeling is pointed out as a prominent tool to analyze theoretical and practical issues. Its lack in studies of chemoimmunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is what motivated us to come up with a simple ordinary differential equation model. It is based on ideas of de Pillis and Radunskaya and on standard pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics assumptions. In order to check the positivity of the state variables, we first establish an invariant region where these time-dependent variables remain positive. Afterwards, the action of the immune system, as well as the chemoimmunotherapeutic role in promoting cancer cure are investigated by means of numerical simulations and the classical linear stability analysis. The role of adoptive cellular immunotherapy is also addressed. Our overall conclusion is that chemoimmunotherapeutic protocols can be effective in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia provided that chemotherapy is not a limiting factor to the immunotherapy efficacy.",

This model consists of four populations - tumor cells, dendritic cells (as an innate immune system), cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells (as a specific immune system) - in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations. Some tumors present dendritic cell and such cells have a potential role in regulating the immune system. In this model, we assume that dendritic cells can activate cytotoxic T cells and, in turn, can clear out tumor cells. Furthermore, by adding controls as a treatment to the model, we minimize both the tumor cell population and the cost of treatment. We do this by applying the optimal control for this problem. First, Pontryagin's Principle is used to characterize the optimal control. Then, the optimal system is solved numerically using the Forward-Backward Runge- Kutta method. Finally, the effect of each treatment is investigated. The numerical results show that these controls are effective in reducing the number of tumor cells.",

Along with this, there have also been some developments on analytical and computational models to help provide insights into clinical observations. This work develops a new mathematical model that combines important interactions between tumor cells and cells in the immune systems including natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells combined with drug delivery to these cell sites. These interactions are described via a system of ordinary differential equations that are solved numerically. A stability analysis of this model is also performed to determine conditions for tumor-free equilibrium to be stable. We also study the influence of proliferation rates and drug interventions in the dynamics of all the cells involved. Another contribution is the development of a novel parameter estimation methodology to determine optimal parameters in the model that can reproduce a given dataset. Our results seem to suggest that the model employed is a robust candidate for studying the dynamics of tumor cells and it helps to provide the dynamic interactions between the tumor cells, immune system, and drug-response systems.",

Computational simulations of our model are carried out for different external temperature stimuli.

In particular, we mainly consider that haematopoietic lineages are tightly controlled by negative feedback inhibition of end-product. Actually, leukemia has been found 100 years ago. Up to now, the exact mechanism is still unknown, and many factors are thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia. Nevertheless, it is very necessary to continue the profound study of the pathogenesis of leukemia. Here, we propose a new mathematical model which include some negative feedback inhibition from the terminally differentiated cells of haematopoietic lineages to the haematopoietic stem cells and haematopoietic progenitor cells in order to describe the regulatory mechanisms mentioned above by a set of ordinary differential equations. Afterwards, we carried out detailed dynamical bifurcation analysis of the model, and obtained some meaningful results. RESULTS:In this work, we mainly perform the analysis of the mathematic model by bifurcation theory and numerical simulations. We have not only incorporated some new negative feedback mechanisms to the existing model, but also constructed our own model by using the modeling method of stem cell theory with probability method. Through a series of qualitative analysis and numerical simulations, we obtain that the weak negative feedback for differentiation probability is conducive to the cure of leukemia. However, with the strengthening of negative feedback, leukemia will be more difficult to be cured, and even induce death. In contrast, strong negative feedback for differentiation rate of progenitor cells can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS:These results demonstrate that healthy progenitor cells are bestowed a competitive advantage over leukaemia stem cells. Weak g1, g2, and h1 enable the system stays in the healthy state. However, strong h2 can promote healthy haematopoiesis and suppress leukaemia.",

A quantitative understanding of the processes involved, which currently remains lacking, will be useful in determining the etiology and treatment of obesity and other conditions resulting from prolonged energy imbalance. Here, we show that a mathematical model of the macronutrient flux balances can capture the long-term dynamics of human weight change; all previous models are special cases of this model. We show that the generic dynamic behavior of body composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two classes. In the first class, the body composition and mass are determined uniquely.

Surprisingly, perturbations of dietary energy intake or energy expenditure can give identical responses in both model classes, and existing data are insufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities.

By the development of molecular biotechnology, many effective viruses are adapted or engineered to make them cancer-specific, such as measles, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus and M1 virus. A successful design of virus needs a full understanding about how viral and host parameters influence the tumor load. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model on the oncolytic virotherapy incorporating viral lytic cycle and virus-specific CTL response. Thresholds for viral treatment and virus-specific CTL response are obtained. Different protocols are given depending on the thresholds. Our results also support that immune suppressive drug can enhance the oncolytic effect of virus as reported in recent literature.",

Stability analysis is used to produce stability regions for various values of certain parameters during mitosis. The stability region of the graph shows that the curve splits the tumor decay and growth regions in the absence of immune response. However, when immune response is present, the tumor growth region is decreased. When drugs are considered in the system, the stability region remains unchanged as the system with the presence of immune response but the population of tumor cells at interphase and metaphase is reduced with percentage differences of 1.27 and 1.53 respectively.

The analysis shows that the expression level of tumour antigens on antigen presenting cells has a distinct influence on the tumour dynamics. At low antigen presentation, a progressive tumour growth takes place to the highest possible value. At high antigen presentation, there is a decrease in tumour size to some value when the dynamical equilibrium between the tumour and the immune system is reached. In the case of the medium antigen presentation, both these regimes can be realized depending on the initial tumour size and the condition of the immune system. A pronounced immunomodulating effect (the suppression of tumour growth and the normalization of IL-2 concentration) is established by considering the influence of low-intensity electromagnetic microwaves as a parametric perturbation of the dynamical system. This finding is in qualitative agreement with the recent experimental results on immunocorrective effects of centimetre electromagnetic waves in tumour-bearing mice.\r\n\r\nVolume 10, Issue 3, Pages 185-201",

Especially for lower steady-state sizes of the population of malignant cells, this equilibrium represents a desirable clinical condition since the tumor growth is blocked. In this context, it is of mandatory importance to analyze the robustness of this clinical favorable state of health in the face of perturbations. To this end, the paper presents an optimization technique to determine whether an assigned rectangular region, which surrounds an asymptotically stable equilibrium point of a quadratic systems, is included into the domain of attraction of the equilibrium itself. The biological relevance of the application of this technique to the analysis of tumor growth dynamics is shown on the basis of a recent quadraticmodel of the tumor\u2013immune system competition dynamics. Indeed the application of the proposedmethodology allows to ensure that a given safety region, determined on the basis of clinical considerations, belongs to the domain of attraction of the tumor blocked equilibrium; therefore for the set of perturbed initial conditions which belong to such region, the convergence to the healthy steady state is guaranteed. The proposed methodology can also provide an optimal strategy for cancer treatment.",

The mathematical model developed presented the following main components: (1) tumour progression in the animals without treatment was described with a linear model, (2) vaccine effects were modelled assuming that vaccine triggers a non-instantaneous immune response inducing cell death. Delayed response was described with a series of two transit compartments, (3) a resistance effect decreasing vaccine efficiency was also incorporated through a regulator compartment dependent upon tumour size, and (4) a mixture model at the level of the elimination of the induced signal vaccine (k 2) to model tumour relapse after treatment, observed in a small percentage of animals (15.6%). The proposed model structure was successfully applied to describe antitumor effect of IL-12, suggesting its applicability to different immune-stimulatory therapies. In addition, a simulation exercise to evaluate in silico the impact on tumour size of possible combination therapies has been shown.

To incorporate both the infection and the immune system, we adopt the style of compartmenting the system to include bacterial dynamics, damage and inflammation to the host, and the host response. We incorporate interactions not previously represented including cross-talk between inflammation\/damage and the infection and the suppression of the anti-inflammatory pathway in response to inflammation\/damage.

The model is able to capture eight different experimental outcomes for mice challenged with intratibial osteomyelitis due to S. aureus, primarily involving immunomodulation and vaccine therapies.

Pancreatic cancer therapy is thus a challenging task, and appropriate prognosis or assessment for pancreatic cancer therapy is of critical importance. In this work, based on available clinical data in Niu et al. (2013) we develop a mathematical prognosis model that can predict the overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients who receive immunotherapy. The mathematical model incorporates pancreatic cancer cells, pancreatic stellate cells, three major classes of immune effector cells CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, helper T cells, and two major classes of cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). The proposed model describes the dynamic interaction between tumor and immune cells. In order for the model to be able to generate appropriate prognostic results for disease progression, the distribution and stability properties of equilibria in the mathematical model are computed and analysed in absence of treatments. In addition, numerical simulations for disease progression with or without treatments are performed. It turns out that the median overall survival associated with CIK immunotherapy is prolonged from 7 to 13months compared with the survival without treatment, this is consistent with the clinical data observed in Niu et al. (2013). The validity of the proposed mathematical prognosis model is thus verified. Our study confirms that immunotherapy offers a better prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients. As a direct extension of this work, various new therapy methods that are under exploration and clinical trials could be assessed or evaluated using the newly developed mathematical prognosis model.",

Here, using mathematical modeling and in vivo optogenetics we reveal for the first time how this neural construct initiates and sustains the appropriate ultradian frequency essential for reproduction. Prompted by mathematical modeling, we show experimentally using female estrous mice that robust pulsatile release of luteinizing hormone, a proxy for GnRH, emerges abruptly as we increase the basal activity of the neuronal network using continuous low-frequency optogenetic stimulation. Further increase in basal activity markedly increases pulse frequency and eventually leads to pulse termination. Additional model predictions that pulsatile dynamics emerge from nonlinear positive and negative feedback interactions mediated through neurokinin-B and dynorphin signaling respectively are confirmed neuropharmacologically. Our results shed light on the long-elusive GnRH pulse generator offering new horizons for reproductive health and wellbeing.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator controls the pulsatile secretion of the gonadotropic hormones LH and FSH and is critical for fertility. The hypothalamic arcuate kisspeptin neurons are thought to represent the GnRH pulse generator, since their oscillatory activity is coincident with LH pulses in the blood; a proxy for GnRH pulses. However, the mechanisms underlying GnRH pulse generation remain elusive. We developed a mathematical model of the kisspeptin neuronal network and confirmed its predictions experimentally, showing how LH secretion is frequency-modulated as we increase the basal activity of the arcuate kisspeptin neurons in vivo using continuous optogenetic stimulation. Our model provides a quantitative framework for understanding the reproductive neuroendocrine system and opens new horizons for fertility regulation.",

It is known from numerical simulations that the corresponding three-dimensional system of ODEs has periodic solutions in certain parameter regimes. We prove the existence of a stable limit cycle and provide a detailed description on how the limit cycle is generated. The limit cycle corresponds to a relaxation oscillation of an auxiliary system, which is singularly perturbed and has the same orbits as the original model. The singular perturbation character of the auxiliary problem is caused by the occurrence of small Michaelis constants in the model. Essential pieces of the limit cycle of the auxiliary problem consist of segments of slow motion close to several branches of a two dimensional critical manifold which are connected by fast jumps. In addition, a new phenomenon of exchange of stability occurs at lines, where the branches of the two-dimensional critical manifold intersect. This novel type of relaxation oscillations is studied by combining standard results from geometric singular perturbation with several suitable blow-up transformations.",

        "abstract":"The eukaryotic cell cycle is characterized by alternating oscillations in the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Successful completion of the cell cycle is dependent on the precise, temporally ordered appearance of these activities. A modest level of Cdk activity is sufficient to initiate DNA replication, but mitosis and APC activation require an elevated Cdk activity. In present-day eukaryotes, this temporal order is provided by a complex network of regulatory proteins that control both Cdk and APC activities via sharp thresholds, bistability, and time delays. Using simple computational models, we show here that these dynamical features of cell-cycle organization could emerge in a control system driven by a single Cdk\/cyclin complex and APC wired in a negative-feedback loop. We show that ordered phosphorylation of cellular proteins could be explained by multisite phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation and competition of substrates for interconverting kinase (Cdk) and phosphatase. In addition, the competition of APC substrates for ubiquitylation can create and maintain sustained oscillations in cyclin levels. We propose a sequence of models that gets closer and closer to a realistic model of cell-cycle control in yeast. Since these models lack the elaborate control mechanisms characteristic of modern eukaryotes, they suggest that bistability and time delay may have characterized eukaryotic cell divisions before the current cell-cycle control network evolved in all its complexity.",

In the presence of sufficient amounts of growth factor, the skeleton model also passes from a stable steady state to sustained oscillations of the various cyclin\/Cdk complexes. This transition corresponds to the switch from quiescence to cell proliferation. Sequential activation of the cyclin\/Cdk complexes allows the ordered progression along the G1, S, G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. The 5-variable model can also account for the existence of a restriction point in G1, and for endoreplication.

We find that in areas of low transmission, the reproductive number and the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans are most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate. In areas of high transmission, the reproductive number is again most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate, but the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans is most sensitive to the human recovery rate.

To this end, in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the Cdk counteracting phosphatase Cdc14 is activated. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus by its inhibitor Net1. During anaphase, Cdk- and Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 is thought to release active Cdc14. How Net1 is phosphorylated specifically in anaphase, when mitotic kinase activity starts to decline, has remained unexplained. Here, we show that PP2A(Cdc55) phosphatase keeps Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase. The sister chromatid-separating protease separase, activated at anaphase onset, interacts with and downregulates PP2A(Cdc55), thereby facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2A(Cdc55) downregulation also promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the \"mitotic exit network\" that sustains Cdc14 as Cdk activity declines.

        "abstract":"The properties of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells depend crucially on the agonist used to stimulate them. Acetylcholine or carbachol (CCh) cause high-frequency (10-12-s period) calcium oscillations that are superimposed on a raised baseline, while cholecystokinin (CCK) causes long-period (>100-s period) baseline spiking. We show that physiological concentrations of CCK induce rapid phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor, which is not true of physiological concentrations of CCh. Based on this and other experimental data, we construct a mathematical model of agonist-specific intracellular calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells. Model simulations agree with previous experimental work on the rates of activation and inactivation of the IP3 receptor by calcium (DuFour, J.-F., I.M. Arias, and T.J. Turner. 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272:2675-2681), and reproduce both short-period, raised baseline oscillations, and long-period baseline spiking. The steady state open probability curve of the model IP3 receptor is an increasing function of calcium concentration, as found for type-III IP3 receptors by Hagar et al. (Hagar, R.E., A.D. Burgstahler, M.H. Nathanson, and B.E. Ehrlich. 1998. Nature. 396:81-84). We use the model to predict the effect of the removal of external calcium, and this prediction is confirmed experimentally. We also predict that, for type-III IP3 receptors, the steady state open probability curve will shift to lower calcium concentrations as the background IP3 concentration increases. We conclude that the differences between CCh- and CCK-induced calcium oscillations in pancreatic acinar cells can be explained by two principal mechanisms: (a) CCK causes more phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor than does CCh, and the phosphorylated receptor cannot pass calcium current; and (b) the rate of calcium ATPase pumping and the rate of calcium influx from the outside the cell are greater in the presence of CCh than in the presence of CCK.",

        "abstract":"We extend the study of a computational model recently proposed for the mammalian circadian clock (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 100 (2003) 7051). The model, based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, and Clock genes, can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by some peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian oscillations, we compare the effect of the various parameters and show that both the occurrence and the period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related to synthesis or degradation of Bmal1 mRNA and BMAL1 protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between PER and CRY and the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. Thus, sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological conditions, and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark (LD) cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in LD critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of CRY protein. Small changes in the parameters governing CRY levels can shift the peak in Per mRNA from the L to the D phase, or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep-wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian clock, such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome.",

Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. METHODS:A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number (Rc), as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio- Re(t), of the disease transmission in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. RESULTS:The estimation outcomes indicate that Rc is 3.36 (95% CI: 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to a prolonged disease transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause a second wave of epidemic or outbreaks. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. CONCLUSIONS:To ensure the pandemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in the mainland of China apart from Hubei province.",

The genetic defect responsible for DMD has been known for over 25 years, yet at present there is neither cure nor effective treatment for DMD. During early disease onset, the mdx mouse has been validated as an animal model for DMD and use of this model has led to valuable but incomplete insights into the disease process. For example, immune cells are thought to be responsible for a significant portion of muscle cell death in the mdx mouse; however, the role and time course of the immune response in the dystrophic process have not been well described. In this paper we constructed a simple mathematical model to investigate the role of the immune response in muscle degeneration and subsequent regeneration in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Our model suggests that the immune response contributes substantially to the muscle degeneration and regeneration processes. Furthermore, the analysis of the model predicts that the immune system response oscillates throughout the life of the mice, and the damaged fibers are never completely cleared.",

The alternative pathway (AP) has a central role in the function of the CS. The AP of complement system is implicated in several human disease pathologies. In the absence of triggers, the AP exists in a time-invariant resting state (physiological steady state). It is capable of rapid, potent and transient activation response upon challenge with a trigger. Previous models of AP have focused on the activation response. In order to understand the molecular machinery necessary for AP activation and regulation of a physiological steady state, we built parsimonious AP models using experimentally supported kinetic parameters.

In this paper, a new mathematical model of tumor cells growth is established to dynamically demonstrate the effects of abnormal cell progression on the cells affected by the tumor in terms of the immune system\u2019s functionality and normal cells\u2019 dynamic growth. This model is called the normal-tumor-immune-unhealthy diet model (NTIUNHDM) and governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. In the NTIUNHDM, there are three main populations normal cells, tumor cell and immune cells. The model is discussed analytically and numerically by utilizing a fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta method. The dynamic behavior of the NTIUNHDM is discussed by analyzing the stability of the system at various equilibrium points and the Mathematica software is used to simulate the model. From analysis and simulation of the NTIUNHDM, it can be deduced that instability of the response stage, due to a weak immune system, is classified as one of the main reasons for the coexistence of abnormal cells and normal cells. Additionally, it is obvious that the NTIUNHDM has only one stable case when abnormal cells begin progressing into early stages of tumor cells such that the immune cells are generated once. Thus, early boosting of the immune system might contribute to reducing the risk of cancer.",

The purpose of this paper is to develop a first mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions in the bladder as a result of BCG therapy. A mathematical analysis of the ODE model identifies multiple equilibrium points, their stability properties, and bifurcation points. Intriguing regimes of bistability are identified in which treatment has potential to result in a tumor-free equilibrium or a full-blown tumor depending only on initial conditions. Attention is given to estimating parameters and validating the model using published data taken from in vitro, mouse and human studies. The model makes clear that intensity of immunotherapy must be kept in limited bounds. While small treatment levels may fail to clear the tumor, a treatment that is too large can lead to an over-stimulated immune system having dangerous side effects for the patient.",

Limiting the tumor growth and, concurrently, avoiding the toxicity of a drug, is the problem of protocol design. We formulate this question as an optimization problem and derive an algorithm for its solution. Unlike the standard optimal control approach, the algorithm simulates impulse-like drug administrations. It relies on an exact computation of the gradient of the cost function with respect to any protocol by means of the variational equations, that can be solved in parallel with the system. In comparison with previous versions of this method [F. Castiglione, B. Piccoli, Optimal control in a model of dendritic cell transfection cancer immunotherapy, Bull. Math. Biol. 68 (2006) 255-274; B. Piccoli, F. Castiglione, Optimal vaccine scheduling in cancer immunotherapy, Physica A. 370 (2) (2007) 672-680], we optimize both the timing and the dosage of each administration and introduce a penalty term to avoid clustering of subsequent injections, a requirement consistent with the clinical practice. In addition, we implement the optimization scheme to simulate the case of multi-therapies. The procedure works for any ODE system describing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an arbitrary number of therapeutic agents. In this work, it was tested for a well known model of the tumor-immune system interaction [D. Kirschner, J.C. Panetta, Modeling immunotherapy of tumor-immune interaction, J. Math. Biol. 37 (1998) 235-252]. Exploring three immunotherapeutic scenarios (CTL therapy, IL-2 therapy and combined therapy), we display the stability and efficacy of the optimization method, obtaining protocols that are successful compromises between various clinical requirements.",

As this cascade culminates, activation of the protease thrombin occurs and soluble fibrinogen is converted into an insoluble polymerized fibrin network. Fibrin polymerization is critical for bleeding cessation and subsequent stages of wound healing. We develop a cooperative enzyme kinetics model for in vitro fibrin matrix polymerization capturing dynamic interactions among fibrinogen, thrombin, fibrin, and intermediate complexes. A tailored parameter subset selection technique is also developed to evaluate parameter identifiability for a representative data curve for fibrin accumulation in a short-duration in vitro polymerization experiment. Our approach is based on systematic analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the classical information matrix for simulations of accumulating fibrin matrix via optimization based on a least squares objective function. Results demonstrate robustness of our approach in that a significant reduction in objective function cost is achieved relative to a more ad hoc curve-fitting procedure. Capabilities of this approach to integrate non-overlapping subsets of the data to enhance the evaluation of parameter identifiability are also demonstrated. Unidentifiable reaction rate parameters are screened to determine whether individual reactions can be eliminated from the overall system while preserving the low objective cost. These findings demonstrate the high degree of information within a single fibrin accumulation curve, and a tailored model and parameter subset selection approach for improving optimization and reducing model complexity in the context of polymerization experiments.",

        "abstract":"The intrinsic firing modes of adult CA1 pyramidal cells vary along a continuum of \"burstiness\" from regular firing to rhythmic bursting, depending on the ionic composition of the extracellular milieu. Burstiness is low in neurons exposed to a normal extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](o)), but is markedly enhanced by lowering [Ca(2+)](o), although not by blocking Ca(2+) and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents. We show, using intracellular recordings, that burstiness in low [Ca(2+)](o) persists even after truncating the apical dendrites, suggesting that bursts are generated by an interplay of membrane currents at or near the soma. To study the mechanisms of bursting, we have constructed a conductance-based, one-compartment model of CA1 pyramidal neurons. In this neuron model, reduced [Ca(2+)](o) is simulated by negatively shifting the activation curve of the persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)) as indicated by recent experimental results. The neuron model accounts, with different parameter sets, for the diversity of firing patterns observed experimentally in both zero and normal [Ca(2+)](o). Increasing I(NaP) in the neuron model induces bursting and increases the number of spikes within a burst but is neither necessary nor sufficient for bursting. We show, using fast-slow analysis and bifurcation theory, that the M-type K(+) current (I(M)) allows bursting by shifting neuronal behavior between a silent and a tonically active state provided the kinetics of the spike generating currents are sufficiently, although not extremely, fast. We suggest that bursting in CA1 pyramidal cells can be explained by a single compartment \"square bursting\" mechanism with one slow variable, the activation of I(M).",

A major effort was devoted to compare the use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling. METHODS: A temperature model was formulated including circadian rhythm, metabolism, heat loss, and a thermoregulatory set-point. This model was formulated as a mixed-effects model based on SDEs using NONMEM. RESULTS: The effects of IL-21 were on the set-point and the circadian rhythm of metabolism. The model was able to describe a complex set of IL-21 induced phenomena, including 1) disappearance of the circadian rhythm, 2) no effect after first dose, and 3) high variability after second dose. SDEs provided a more realistic description with improved simulation properties, and further changed the model into one that could not be falsified by the autocorrelation function. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-21 induced effects on thermoregulation in cynomolgus monkeys are explained by a biologically plausible model. The quality of the model was improved by the use of SDEs.",

        "abstract":"Fast neuronal oscillations (gamma, 20-80 Hz) have been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus during behavioral arousal. Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency-current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size. By changing the GABAA synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20-80 Hz) range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.",

        "abstract":"Upon acute viral infection, a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles at a relatively stable memory level. Recently, experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had resolved, some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as \"CTL memory inflation\". In order to examine the dynamics of this system further, we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this model, a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer (NK) cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute infection, but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific CD8+T cells seen in humans as they age.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antibiotics against M. tuberculosis has been shown to be influenced by experimental media conditions. Investigations of M. tuberculosis growth in physiological conditions have described an environment that is different from common in vitro media. Thus, elucidating the interplay between available nutrient sources and antibiotic efficacy has clear medical relevance. While genome-scale reconstructions of M. tuberculosis have enabled the ability to interrogate media differences for the past 10\u00a0years, recent reconstructions have diverged from each other without standardization. A unified reconstruction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv would elucidate the impact of different nutrient conditions on antibiotic efficacy and provide new insights for therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: We present a new genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, named iEK1011, that unifies and updates previous M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome-scale reconstructions. We functionally assess iEK1011 against previous models and show that the model increases correct gene essentiality predictions on two different experimental datasets by 6% (53% to 60%) and 18% (60% to 71%), respectively. We compared simulations between in vitro and approximated in vivo media conditions to examine the predictive capabilities of iEK1011. The simulated differences recapitulated literature defined characteristics in the rewiring of TCA metabolism including succinate secretion, gluconeogenesis, and activation of both the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle. To assist efforts to elucidate mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development, we curated 16 metabolic genes related to antimicrobial resistance and approximated evolutionary drivers of resistance. Comparing simulations of these antibiotic resistance features between in vivo and in vitro media highlighted condition-dependent differences that may influence the efficacy of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: iEK1011 provides a computational knowledge base for exploring the impact of different environmental conditions on the metabolic state of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. As more experimental data and knowledge of M. tuberculosis H37Rv become available, a unified and standardized M. tuberculosis model will prove to be a valuable resource to the research community studying the systems biology of M. tuberculosis.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The metabolic capabilities of acetogens to ferment a wide range of sugars, to grow autotrophically on H(2)\/CO(2), and more importantly on synthesis gas (H(2)\/CO\/CO(2)) make them very attractive candidates as production hosts for biofuels and biocommodities. Acetogenic metabolism is considered one of the earliest modes of bacterial metabolism. A thorough understanding of various factors governing the metabolism, in particular energy conservation mechanisms, is critical for metabolic engineering of acetogens for targeted production of desired chemicals. RESULTS: Here, we present the genome-scale metabolic network of Clostridium ljungdahlii, the first such model for an acetogen. This genome-scale model (iHN637) consisting of 637 genes, 785 reactions, and 698 metabolites captures all the major central metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, in particular pathways involved in carbon fixation and energy conservation. A combination of metabolic modeling, with physiological and transcriptomic data provided insights into autotrophic metabolism as well as aided the characterization of a nitrate reduction pathway in C. ljungdahlii. Analysis of the iHN637 metabolic model revealed that flavin based electron bifurcation played a key role in energy conservation during autotrophic growth and helped identify genes for some of the critical steps in this mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: iHN637 represents a predictive model that recapitulates experimental data, and provides valuable insights into the metabolic response of C. ljungdahlii to genetic perturbations under various growth conditions. Thus, the model will be instrumental in guiding metabolic engineering of C. ljungdahlii for the industrial production of biocommodities and biofuels.",

Since the publication of P. putida KT2440's genome, some in silico analyses of its metabolic and biotechnology capacities have been published. However, global understanding of the capabilities of P. putida KT2440 requires the construction of a metabolic model that enables the integration of classical experimental data along with genomic and high-throughput data. The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) approach has been successfully used to build and analyze in silico genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. RESULTS: We present a genome-scale reconstruction of P. putida KT2440's metabolism, iJN746, which was constructed based on genomic, biochemical, and physiological information. This manually-curated reconstruction accounts for 746 genes, 950 reactions, and 911 metabolites. iJN746 captures biotechnologically relevant pathways, including polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis and catabolic pathways of aromatic compounds (e.g., toluene, benzoate, phenylacetate, nicotinate), not described in other metabolic reconstructions or biochemical databases. The predictive potential of iJN746 was validated using experimental data including growth performance and gene deletion studies. Furthermore, in silico growth on toluene was found to be oxygen-limited, suggesting the existence of oxygen-efficient pathways not yet annotated in P. putida's genome. Moreover, we evaluated the production efficiency of polyhydroxyalkanoates from various carbon sources and found fatty acids as the most prominent candidates, as expected. CONCLUSION: Here we presented the first genome-scale reconstruction of P. putida, a biotechnologically interesting all-surrounder. Taken together, this work illustrates the utility of iJN746 as i) a knowledge-base, ii) a discovery tool, and iii) an engineering platform to explore P. putida's potential in bioremediation and bioplastic production.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diverse datasets, including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data, are becoming readily available for specific organisms. There is currently a need to integrate these datasets within an in silico modeling framework. Constraint-based models of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 have been developed and used to study the bacterium's metabolism and phenotypic behavior. The most comprehensive E. coli model to date (E. coli iJE660a GSM) accounts for 660 genes and includes 627 unique biochemical reactions. RESULTS: An expanded genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli (iJR904 GSM\/GPR) has been reconstructed which includes 904 genes and 931 unique biochemical reactions. The reactions in the expanded model are both elementally and charge balanced. Network gap analysis led to putative assignments for 55 open reading frames (ORFs). Gene to protein to reaction associations (GPR) are now directly included in the model. Comparisons between predictions made by iJR904 and iJE660a models show that they are generally similar but differ under certain circumstances. Analysis of genome-scale proton balancing shows how the flux of protons into and out of the medium is important for maximizing cellular growth. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli iJR904 has improved capabilities over iJE660a. iJR904 is a more complete and chemically accurate description of E. coli metabolism than iJE660a. Perhaps most importantly, iJR904 can be used for analyzing and integrating the diverse datasets. iJR904 will help to outline the genotype-phenotype relationship for E. coli K-12, as it can account for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and fluxomic data simultaneously.",

Structural analysis revealed that proteins forming the network are dominated by a small number (only 182) of basic shapes (folds) performing diverse, but mostly related functions. Most of these folds are already present in the essential core (~30%) of the network, and its expansion by nonessential proteins is achieved with relatively few additional folds.

Extracellular metabolome or metabolic profiling data, in particular, can provide an insightful view of intracellular physiological states in a noninvasive manner. RESULTS: We used an updated genome-scale metabolic network model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, iMM904, to investigate how changes in the extracellular metabolome can be used to study systemic changes in intracellular metabolic states. The iMM904 metabolic network was reconstructed based on an existing genome-scale network, iND750, and includes 904 genes and 1,412 reactions. The network model was first validated by comparing 2,888 in silico single-gene deletion strain growth phenotype predictions to published experimental data. Extracellular metabolome data measured in response to environmental and genetic perturbations of ammonium assimilation pathways was then integrated with the iMM904 network in the form of relative overflow secretion constraints and a flux sampling approach was used to characterize candidate flux distributions allowed by these constraints. Predicted intracellular flux changes were consistent with published measurements on intracellular metabolite levels and fluxes. Patterns of predicted intracellular flux changes could also be used to correctly identify the regions of the metabolic network that were perturbed. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that integrating quantitative extracellular metabolomic profiles in a constraint-based framework enables inferring changes in intracellular metabolic flux states. Similar methods could potentially be applied towards analyzing biofluid metabolome variations related to human physiological and disease states.",

Even in industrialized countries, the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of tuberculosis hails the need to develop additional medications for treatment. Many of the drugs used for treatment of tuberculosis target metabolic enzymes. Genome-scale models can be used for analysis, discovery, and as hypothesis generating tools, which will hopefully assist the rational drug development process. These models need to be able to assimilate data from large datasets and analyze them. RESULTS: We completed a bottom up reconstruction of the metabolic network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. This functional in silico bacterium, iNJ661, contains 661 genes and 939 reactions and can produce many of the complex compounds characteristic to tuberculosis, such as mycolic acids and mycocerosates. We grew this bacterium in silico on various media, analyzed the model in the context of multiple high-throughput data sets, and finally we analyzed the network in an 'unbiased' manner by calculating the Hard Coupled Reaction (HCR) sets, groups of reactions that are forced to operate in unison due to mass conservation and connectivity constraints. CONCLUSION: Although we observed growth rates comparable to experimental observations (doubling times ranging from about 12 to 24 hours) in different media, comparisons of gene essentiality with experimental data were less encouraging (generally about 55%). The reasons for the often conflicting results were multi-fold, including gene expression variability under different conditions and lack of complete biological knowledge. Some of the inconsistencies between in vitro and in silico or in vivo and in silico results highlight specific loci that are worth further experimental investigations. Finally, by considering the HCR sets in the context of known drug targets for tuberculosis treatment we proposed new alternative, but equivalent drug targets.",

Metabolism in Y. pestis displays remarkable flexibility and robustness, allowing the bacterium to proliferate in both warm-blooded mammalian hosts and cold-blooded insect vectors such as fleas. RESULTS: Here we report a genome-scale reconstruction and mathematical model of metabolism for Y. pestis CO92 and supporting experimental growth and metabolite measurements. The model contains 815 genes, 678 proteins, 963 unique metabolites and 1678 reactions, accurately simulates growth on a range of carbon sources both qualitatively and quantitatively, and identifies gaps in several key biosynthetic pathways and suggests how those gaps might be filled. Furthermore, our model presents hypotheses to explain certain known nutritional requirements characteristic of this strain. CONCLUSIONS: Y. pestis continues to be a dangerous threat to human health during modern times. The Y. pestis genome-scale metabolic reconstruction presented here, which has been benchmarked against experimental data and correctly reproduces known phenotypes, provides an in silico platform with which to investigate the metabolism of this important human pathogen.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several strains of bacteria have sequenced and annotated genomes, which have been used in conjunction with biochemical and physiological data to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic networks. Such reconstruction amounts to a two-dimensional annotation of the genome. These networks have been analyzed with a constraint-based formalism and a variety of biologically meaningful results have emerged. Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium that has evolved resistance to many antibiotics, representing a significant health care concern. We present the first manually curated elementally and charge balanced genome-scale reconstruction and model of S. aureus' metabolic networks and compute some of its properties. RESULTS: We reconstructed a genome-scale metabolic network of S. aureus strain N315. This reconstruction, termed iSB619, consists of 619 genes that catalyze 640 metabolic reactions. For 91% of the reactions, open reading frames are explicitly linked to proteins and to the reaction. All but three of the metabolic reactions are both charge and elementally balanced. The reaction list is the most complete to date for this pathogen. When the capabilities of the reconstructed network were analyzed in the context of maximal growth, we formed hypotheses regarding growth requirements, the efficiency of growth on different carbon sources, and potential drug targets. These hypotheses can be tested experimentally and the data gathered can be used to improve subsequent versions of the reconstruction. CONCLUSION: iSB619 represents comprehensive biochemically and genetically structured information about the metabolism of S. aureus to date. The reconstructed metabolic network can be used to predict cellular phenotypes and thus advance our understanding of a troublesome pathogen.",

To study its metabolism, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model (iYL1228) for strain MGH 78578, experimentally determined its biomass composition, experimentally determined its ability to grow on a broad range of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur sources, and assessed the ability of the model to accurately simulate growth versus no growth on these substrates. The model contains 1,228 genes encoding 1,188 enzymes that catalyze 1,970 reactions and accurately simulates growth on 84% of the substrates tested. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of growth rates between the model and experimental data for nine of the substrates also showed good agreement.

Salmonella enterica subspecies I serovar Typhimurium is a human pathogen, causes various diseases and its increasing antibiotic resistance poses a public health problem. RESULTS: Here, we describe a community-driven effort, in which more than 20 experts in S. Typhimurium biology and systems biology collaborated to reconcile and expand the S. Typhimurium BiGG knowledge-base. The consensus MR was obtained starting from two independently developed MRs for S. Typhimurium. Key results of this reconstruction jamboree include i) development and implementation of a community-based workflow for MR annotation and reconciliation; ii) incorporation of thermodynamic information; and iii) use of the consensus MR to identify potential multi-target drug therapy approaches. CONCLUSION: Taken together, with the growing number of parallel MRs a structured, community-driven approach will be necessary to maximize quality while increasing adoption of MRs in experimental design and interpretation.",

This reconstruction, iIT341 GSM\/GPR, represents a detailed review of the current literature about H. pylori as it integrates biochemical and genomic data in a comprehensive framework. In total, it accounts for 341 metabolic genes, 476 intracellular reactions, 78 exchange reactions, and 485 metabolites. Novel features of iIT341 GSM\/GPR include (i) gene-protein-reaction associations, (ii) elementally and charge-balanced reactions, (iii) more accurate descriptions of isoprenoid and lipopolysaccharide metabolism, and (iv) quantitative assessments of the supporting data for each reaction. This metabolic reconstruction was used to carry out in silico deletion studies to identify essential and conditionally essential genes in H. pylori. A total of 128 essential and 75 conditionally essential metabolic genes were identified. Predicted growth phenotypes of single knockouts were validated using published experimental data.

Optimizing photosynthetic organisms for biomass or biofuel production will therefore require a systems understanding of photosynthetic processes. We reconstructed a high-quality genome-scale metabolic network for Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 that describes key photosynthetic processes in mechanistic detail. We performed an exhaustive in silico analysis of the reconstructed photosynthetic process under different light and inorganic carbon (Ci) conditions as well as under genetic perturbations. Our key results include the following. (i) We identified two main states of the photosynthetic apparatus: a Ci-limited state and a light-limited state. (ii) We discovered nine alternative electron flow pathways that assist the photosynthetic linear electron flow in optimizing the photosynthesis performance. (iii) A high degree of cooperativity between alternative pathways was found to be critical for optimal autotrophic metabolism. Although pathways with high photosynthetic yield exist for optimizing growth under suboptimal light conditions, pathways with low photosynthetic yield guarantee optimal growth under excessive light or Ci limitation. (iv) Photorespiration was found to be essential for the optimal photosynthetic process, clarifying its role in high-light acclimation. Finally, (v) an extremely high photosynthetic robustness drives the optimal autotrophic metabolism at the expense of metabolic versatility and robustness. The results and modeling approach presented here may promote a better understanding of the photosynthetic process. They can also guide bioengineering projects toward optimal biofuel production in photosynthetic organisms.",

The regular firing of a Hodgkin-Huxley neurone endowed with fast Na+ and delayed K+ channels can be converted into adapting firing by appending HERG (human eag-related gene) channels. 2. The computer model predictions were verified by studying the firing properties of F-11 DRG neurone x neuroblastoma hybrid cells induced to differentiate by long-term exposure to retinoic acid. These cells, which express HERG currents (IHERG), show clear spike-frequency adaptation of their firing when current clamped with long depolarizations. 3. In agreement with the prediction, the selective blocking of IHERG by class III antiarrhythmic drugs always led to the disappearance of the spike-frequency adaptation, and the conversion of adapting firing to regular firing. 4. It is proposed that, in addition to their role in the repolarization of the heart action potential, HERG channels may sustain a process of spike-frequency adaptation, and hence contribute to the control of burst duration in a way that is similar to that of the K+ currents, IAHP, IC and IM. In addition to the known cardiac arrhythmia syndrome (LQT2), genetic mutations or an altered HERG expression could lead to continuous hyperexcitable states sustained by the inability of nerve or endocrine cells to accommodate to repetitive stimuli.

This relative phase is determined by the \ninteraction between synaptic inputs to the neurons and their intrinsic \nproperties. We show, in a simplified network consisting of an oscillator \ninhibiting a follower neuron, how the interaction between synaptic depression\nand a transient potassium current in the follower neuron determines the \nactivity phase of this neuron. We derive a mathematical expression to \ndetermine at what phase of the oscillation the follower neuron becomes \nactive. This expression can be used to understand which parameters determine\nthe phase of activity of the follower as the frequency of the oscillator is \nchanged. We show that in the presence of synaptic depression, there can be \nthree distinct frequency intervals, in which the phase of the follower neuron\nis determined by different sets of parameters. Alternatively, when the \nsynapse is not depressing, only one set of parameters determines the phase of\nactivity at all frequencies.\n\n---\n\nThis model is a a Morris-Lecar system with IA and depression.\nThe interesting phase plane for the \"middle\" branch is the v vs. ha. \nNote also that the v vs w phase plane can have a quintic v nullcline.\n\nTo run the models:\nMatlab: after you add the path of the activityphase directory start the \nDBjcns1.m file.

Cellular consequences of HERG mutations in the long QT \nsyndrome:precursors to sudden cardiac death.

LQT2 may give rise to \nsevere arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to sudden cardiac death.\nOBJECTIVE: We attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2\ngenotypes can lead to prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) \nand consequently the QT interval on the ECG. \nMETHODS: We develop Markovian models of wild-type (WT) and mutant I(Kr)\nchannels and incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of the \ncardiac ventricular cell. RESULTS: Using this virtual transgenic cell model, \nwe describe the effects of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action\npotential (AP) and provide insight into the mechanism by which each defect \nresults in a net loss of repolarizing current and prolongation of APD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates which mutations can prolong APD\nsufficiently to generate early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may trigger\nlife-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the phenotype is shown to \ndepend on the specific kinetic changes and how they affect I(Kr) during the\ntime course of the action potential. Clarifying how defects in HERG can lead\nto impaired cellular electrophysiology can improve our understanding of the \nlink between channel structure and cellular function.\n-------------------------------------\n\n[Rudy lab site reference to model](http:\/\/rudylab.wustl.edu\/research\/cell\/methodology\/markov\/clancy_herg.htm) \n\nModel:\nC1<==>C2<==>C3<==>O<==>I\n\nIKr = G Kr * P(O) * (V m -E K ) \nP(O) = open probability of I Kr \nG Kr = 0.0135 * ([K + ] o ) 0.59 \nE K = (R*T\/F) * ln([K + ] o \/[K + ] i ) \nWild-type rate constants \nC1 ==> O or C1 ==> I \naa = 65.5*e-3 * exp (0.05547153*(v-36)) \nC2 ==> C1 \na in = 2.172 \nC3 ==> C2 \na = 55.5 *e-3 * exp (0.05547153*(v-12)) \nC2 ==> C3 \nb = 2.357*e-3 * exp (-0.036588*(v)) \nC1 ==> C2 \nb in = 1.077 \nO ==> C1 \nbb = 2.9357*e-3 * exp (-0.02158*(v)) \nI ==> O \nai = 0.439 * exp (-0.02352*(v+25)) * 4.5\/[K + ] o \nO ==> I \nbi = 0.656 * exp (0.000942*(v)) * (4.5\/ [K + ] o ) 0.3 \nI ==> C1 \nmu = (ai * bb * aa)\/(aa *bi) \n\n#T474I rates \n#C1 ==> O \n#aa = 65.5*e-3 * exp (0.05547153*(v+25)) \n#C3 ==> C2 \n#a = 55.5*e-3 * exp (0.05547153*(v+6)) \n\n#R56Q rates \n#C2 ==> C3 \n#b = 2.357*e-3 * exp (-0.036588*(v)) * 10.5 \n#O ==> C1 \n#bb = 2.9357*e-3 * exp (-0.02158*(v))* 6.3 \n\n#N629D rates \n#O ==> I \n#bi = 0.0 \n#N629D loss of selectivity \n\nNa:K permeability (P Na \/P K ) = 0.65 \nE K = \n(R*T\/F) * ln([K + ] o + P Na \/P K * [Na + ] o \/ [K + ] i + P Na \/P K * [Na + ] i )\n\nSyntax note: e-n is 10 -n exp (n) is e n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo run the models:\nXPP: start with the command\n\nxppaut IERG\\_Mar.ode\n\nMouse click on Initialconds, and then (G)o.\nThis makes a trace similar to fig 4B (0mV) of the paper.\nTo obtain the other traces in figure 4B you can press\nthe Param button on the top of the XPP screen.

We observe that interaction between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (the \u03b2-subunit) confers kinetic properties on I(Ks) that make it suitable for participation in action potential repolarization and its adaptation to rate changes; in particular, the channel develops an available reserve of closed states near the open state that can open rapidly on demand. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its ability to form an available reserve, I(Ks) can function as a repolarization reserve when I(Kr), the rapid delayed rectifier, is reduced by disease or drug and can prevent excessive action potential prolongation and development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations.",

These channels are regulated by intracellular\nADP\/ATP ratio and play a role in cellular metabolism. Diethyl \npyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidine-specific alkylating reagent, is\nknown to modify the histidine residues of the structure of \nproteins. The objective of this study was to determine whether \nDEPC modifies K(ATP)-channel activity in pituitary GH(3) cells. \nSteady-state fluctuation analyses of macroscopic K(+) current at \n-120mV produced power spectra that could be fitted with a single \nLorentzian curve in these cells. The time constants in the \npresence of DEPC were increased. Consistent with fluctuation \nanalyses, the mean open time of K(ATP)-channels was significantly\nincreased during exposure to DEPC. However, DEPC produced no\nchange in single-channel conductance, despite the ability of this\ncompound to enhance K(ATP)-channel activity in a concentration-\ndependent manner with an EC(50) value of 16muM. DEPC-stimulated \nK(ATP)-channel activity was attenuated by pretreatment with \nglibenclamide. In current-clamp configuration, DEPC decreased the\nfiring of action potentials in GH(3) cells. A further application\nof glibenclamide reversed DEPC- induced inhibition of spontaneous\naction potentials. Intracellullar Ca(2+) measurements revealed \nthe ability of DEPC to decrease Ca(2+) oscillations in GH(3) \ncells. Simulation studies also demonstrated that the increased \nconductance of K(ATP)-channels used to mimic DEPC actions reduced\nthe frequency of spontaneous action potentials and fluctuation of\nintracellular Ca(2+).

We formulate a reduction of this model that permits a detailed bifurcation analysis, and show that the reduced model is a reasonable approximation of the full model. We find that competition between intrinsic neuronal currents, sodium-potassium pumps, glia, and diffusion can produce very slow and large-amplitude oscillations in ion concentrations similar to what is seen physiologically in seizures.

However, the ionic mechanism of OXC actions in neurons\nremains incompletely understood. With the aid of patch-clamp\ntechnology, we first investigated the effects of OXC on ion currents\nin NG108-15 neuronal cells differentiated with cyclic AMP.

OXC (3 mum) could shift the\nsteady-state inactivation of INa to a more negative membrane potential\nby approximately -9 mV with no effect on the slope of the inactivation\ncurve, and produce a significant prolongation in the recovery of INa\ninactivation. Additionally, OXC was effective in suppressing\npersistent INa (INa(P)) elicited by long ramp pulses. The blockade of\nINa by OXC does not simply reduce current magnitude, but alters\ncurrent kinetics. Moreover, OXC could suppress the amplitude of\ndelayed rectifier K+ current (IK(DR)), with no effect on M-type K+\ncurrent (IK(M)). In current-clamp configuration, OXC could reduce the\namplitude of action potentials and prolong action-potential\nduration. Furthermore, the simulations, based on hippocampal pyramidal\nneurons (Pinsky-Rinzel model) and a network of the Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodel, were analysed to investigate the effect of OXC on action\npotentials. Taken together, our results suggest that the synergistic\nblocking effects on INa and IK(DR) may contribute to the underlying\nmechanisms through which OXC affects neuronal function in vivo.\n\n\nTo run the model:\nExpand the archive and cd into the newly created directory and run:\nxppaut neuron\\_oxc.ode\nthen click on Initialcond -> Go\nThe potential trace is shown in the lower part of Figure 9b in the paper of \nHuang et al (2008):\n\n!\n\nThe model file was supplied by:\n\nDr. Sheng-Nan Wu\nNational Cheng Kung University Medical College\nTainan 70101, Taiwan\nsnwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",

The model is based, whenever possible,\non recent single-cell and single-channel data and incorporates the\npossibility of changing extracellular potassium concentration\n[K]o. The fast sodium current, INa, is characterized by fast upstroke\nvelocity (Vmax = 400 V\/sec) and slow recovery from inactivation. The\ntime-independent potassium current, IK1, includes a negative-slope\nphase and displays significant crossover phenomenon as [K]o is\nvaried. The time-dependent potassium current, IK, shows only a minimal\ndegree of crossover. A novel potassium current that activates at\nplateau potentials is included in the model. The simulated action\npotential duplicates the experimentally observed effects of changes in\n[K]o on action potential duration and rest potential. Physiological\nsimulations focus on the interaction between depolarization and\nrepolarization (i.e., premature stimulation). Results demonstrate the\nimportance of the slow recovery of INa in determining the response of\nthe cell. Simulated responses to periodic stimulation include\nmonotonic Wenckebach patterns and alternans at normal [K]o, whereas at\nlow [K]o nonmonotonic Wenckebach periodicities, aperiodic patterns,\nand enhanced supernormal excitability that results in unstable\nresponses (\"chaotic activity\") are observed.

Slowly inactivating\nIKdr could be elicited by prolonged depolarizations from -50 to +50\nmV. These outward K+ currents were found to decay at potentials above\n-20 mV, and the decay became faster with greater depolarization. Cell\nexposure to aconitine resulted in the reduction of IKdr amplitude\nalong with an accelerated decay of current inactivation. Under\ncurrent-clamp recordings, a delay in the initiation of action\npotentials (APs) in response to prolonged current stimuli was observed\nin these cells. Application of aconitine shortened the AP initiation\nin combination with an increase in both width of spike discharge and\nfiring frequency. The computer model, in which state-dependent\ninactivation of IKdr was incorporated, was also implemented to predict\nthe firing behavior present in NG108-15 cells. As the inactivation\nrate constant of IKdr was elevated, the firing frequency was\nprogressively increased along with a shortening of the latency for AP\nappearance.

The\nmodulation of the action potential by varying the external Ca2+ and K+\nconcentrations is well simulated. The conductance of I(CaL) dominates\nmembrane conductance during the action potential so that an artificial\nincrease of I(to), I(Kr), I(Ks), or I(KATP) magnifies I(CaL)\namplitude.

Oscillations in\ncytosolic Ca2+ arise in this model either spontaneously or in an\nappropriate range of external stimulation; these oscillations \ndo not require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The\nfollowing properties of the model are reviewed and compared with\nexperimental observations: (a) Control of the frequency of Ca2+\noscillations by the external stimulus or extracellular Ca2+; \n(b) correlation of latency with period of Ca2+ oscillations\nobtained at different levels of stimulation; (c) effect of a \ntransient increase in InsP3; (d) phase shift and transient\nsuppression of Ca2+ oscillations by Ca2+ pulses, and \n(e) propagation of Ca2+ waves.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Complex physiological interactions determine the functional consequences of gene abnormalities and make mechanistic interpretation of phenotypes extremely difficult. A recent example is a single mutation in the C terminus of the cardiac Na(+) channel, 1795insD. The mutation causes two distinct clinical syndromes, long QT (LQT) and Brugada, leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate. We develop Markov models of the wild-type and 1795insD cardiac Na(+) channels. By incorporating the models into a virtual transgenic cell, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1795insD differentially disrupts cellular electrical behavior in epicardial and midmyocardial cell types. We provide a cellular mechanistic basis for the ECG abnormalities observed in patients carrying the 1795insD gene mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation can cause both LQT and Brugada syndromes through interaction with the heterogeneous myocardium in a rate-dependent manner. The results highlight the complexity and multiplicity of genotype-phenotype relationships, and the usefulness of computational approaches in establishing a mechanistic link between genetic defects and functional abnormalities.",

Simulations of axonal excitability using a Hodgkin-Huxley\nbased one-compartment model incorporating I(Na), I(K) and leak\ncurrents were used to predict conditions under which the potential\ncontribution of a Ca(2+) current to an evoked action potential could\nbe measured. Under control conditions the inclusion of a high\nthreshold Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) in the model had a negligible effect\non the action potential. Reducing I(K), by decreasing the value of\ng(K), elongated the repolarizing phase of the action potential,\nincreasing its duration. Subsequent incorporation of I(Ca) in the\nmodel revealed a significant I(Ca) contribution to the repolarizing\nphase of the action potential. The simulation thus suggests that\nCa(2+) channels may be present on RON axons, but that pharmacological\nintervention is required to unmask their presence. Experiments based\non the simulations revealed that there was no significant contribution\nof I(Ca) to the control action potential. However, as predicted by the\nsimulation, reducing the repolarizing effect of I(K) by adding the\nK(+) channel blocker 4-AP revealed a Ca(2+) component on the\nrepolarizing phase of the action potential that was blocked by the\nCa(2+) channel inhibitor nifedipine.\n\n------------\n\nTo run the model:\nXPP: start with the command\nxppaut AP-sim-Ca.ode\nThen click on Initialconds -> (G)o\n\nThis simulation will make graphs similar to Figure 1 in the paper by\nBrown.\n\n!\n\nChanges in conductance of potassium and\/or calcium currents can also\nbe implemented.\n\nBard Ermentrout's website: <http:\/\/www.pitt.edu\/~phase\/> describes how\nto get and use XPP.\n\nThis model file was submited by:\n\nDr. Sheng-Nan Wu\nDepartment of Pharmaololgy & Toxicology\nVirginia Commonwealth Univesity School of Medicine\nRichmond, Virginia USA\nwshengnan at vcu.edu",

Analysis of single-channel fluctuations distinguishes two Ca2+- and voltage-dependent processes: (a) short-lived channel closure (less than 1 ms) events appearing in a bursting pattern; (b) opening and closing events ranging from one to several hundred milliseconds in duration. The latter process is studied independently of the first and is denoted as the primary gating mode. At constant voltage, the mean open time of the primary gating mode is a linear function of the [Ca2+], whereas the mean closed time is a linear function of the reciprocal [Ca2+]. In the limits of zero and infinite [Ca2+], the mean open and the mean closed times are, respectively, independent of voltage. These results are predicted by a kinetic scheme consisting of the following reaction steps: (a) binding of Ca2+ to a closed state; (b) channel opening; (c) binding of a second Ca2+ ion. In this scheme, the two Ca2+ binding reactions are voltage dependent, whereas the open-closed transition is voltage independent. The kinetic constant derived for this scheme gives an accurate theoretical fit to the observed equilibrium open-state probability. The results provide evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism for the activity of an ion channel: modulation by voltage of the binding of an agonist molecule, in this case, Ca2+ ion.",

        "abstract":"The three-phase respiratory pattern observed during normal breathing changes with alterations in metabolic or physiological conditions. A recent study using in situ perfused rat brain preparations demonstrated a reorganization of the respiratory pattern with sequential reduction of the brain stem respiratory network. Specifically, with removal of the pons, the normal three-phase pattern transformed to a two-phase inspiratory\u2013expiratory pattern and, with more caudal transections, to one-phase, intrinsically generated inspiratory oscillations. A minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically participates in the expiratory\u2013inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast\u2013slow decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that, although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst generation. Our results provide important insights for understanding the state-dependent mechanisms for respiratory rhythm generation and control.",

However,\nits effects on the ionic mechanisms remains incompletely understood.\nObjectives: We aimed to investigate EUG's effects on neuronal ionic\ncurrents and excitability, especially on voltagegated ion currents,\nand to verify the effects on a hyperexcitability-temporal lobe seizure\nmodel. Methods With the aid of patch-clamp technology, we first\ninvestigated the effects of EUG on ionic currents in NG108-15 neuronal\ncells differentiated with cyclic AMP. We then used modified\nPinsky-Rinzel simulation modeling to evaluate its effects on\nspontaneous action potentials (APs). Finally, we investigated its\neffects on pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats. Results: EUG\ndepressed the transient and late components of INa in the neurons. It\nnot only increased the degree of INa inactivation, but specifically\nsuppressed the non-inactivating INa (INa(NI)). Its inhibition of\nINa(NI) was reversed by tefluthrin. In addition, EUG diminished\nL-type Ca2+ current and delayed rectifier K+ current only at higher\nconcentrations. EUG's effects on APs frequency reduction was\nverified by the simulation modeling. In pilocarpine-induced seizures,\nthe EUG-treated rats showed no shorter seizure latency but a lower\nseizure severity and mortality than the control rats. The EUG's\neffect on seizure severity was occluded by the INa(NI) antagonist\nriluzole. Conclusion: The synergistic blocking effects of INa and\nINa(NI) contributes to the main mechanism through which EUG affects\nthe firing of neuronal APs and modulate neuronal hyperexcitability\nsuch as pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe seizures.\n---------\n\nTo run the model; XPP: start with the command \nXpp Neuron\\_EUG01.ode\n\nThis simulation will make a graph similar to figure 6.

When model neuron\nis exposed to low-frequency sinusoidal voltage, increased maximal\nconductance of I-TRP can enhance repetitive bursts of APs accompanied\nby a shortening of inter-spike interval (ISI) in AP firing. The change\nin ISIs with number of interval is periodic with the phase-locking. In\naddition, increased maximal conductance of I-TRP can abolish chaotic\npattern of AP firing in model neuron during exposure to high-frequency\nvoltage. The ISI pattern is converted from irregular to constant, as\nmaximal conductance of ITRP is increased under such high-frequency\nvoltage.

Experimental evidence has shown that such dynamics are highly variable between different trials, cells, and cell subcompartments. Here we present a qualitative analysis of a recent mathematical model of astrocyte calcium responses. We show how the major response types are generated in the model as a result of the underlying bifurcation structure. By varying key channel parameters, mimicking blockers used by experimentalists, we manipulate this underlying bifurcation structure and predict how the distributions of responses can change. We find that store-operated calcium channels, plasma membrane bound channels with little activity during calcium transients, have a surprisingly strong effect, underscoring the importance of considering these channels in both experiments and mathematical settings. Variation in the maximum flow in different calcium channels is also shown to determine the range of stable oscillations, as well as set the range of frequencies of the oscillations. Further, by conducting a randomized search through the parameter space and recording the resulting calcium responses, we create a database that can be used by experimentalists to help estimate the underlying channel distribution of their cells.",

Pathological changes in spike generation likely contribute to certain enigmatic features of neurological disease, like paroxysmal attacks of pain and muscle spasm. Paroxysmal symptoms are characterized by abrupt onset and short duration, and are associated with abnormal spiking although the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. To help decipher the biophysical basis for \u2018paroxysmal\u2019 spiking, we replicated afterdischarge (i.e. continued spiking after a brief stimulus) in a minimal conductance-based axon model. We then applied nonlinear dynamical analysis to explain the dynamical basis for initiation and termination of afterdischarge. A perturbation could abruptly switch the system between two (quasi-)stable attractor states: rest and repetitive spiking. This bistability was a consequence of slow positive feedback mediated by persistent inward current. Initiation of afterdischarge was explained by activation of the persistent inward current forcing the system to cross a saddle point that separates the basins of attraction associated with each attractor. Termination of afterdischarge was explained by the attractor associated with repetitive spiking being destroyed. This occurred when ultra-slow negative feedback, such as intracellular sodium accumulation, caused the saddle point and stable limit cycle to collide; in that regard, the active attractor is not truly stable when the slowest dynamics are taken into account. The model also explains other features of paroxysmal symptoms, including temporal summation and refractoriness.",

        "abstract":"In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), interactions between dopamine (DA) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons are critical for regulating DA neuron activity and thus DA efflux. To provide a mechanistic explanation of how GABA neurons influence DA neuron firing, we developed a circuit model of the VTA. The model is based on feed-forward inhibition and recreates canonical features of the VTA neurons. Simulations revealed that \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (GABAR) stimulation can differentially influence the firing pattern of the DA neuron, depending on the level of synchronization among GABA neurons. Asynchronous activity of GABA neurons provides a constant level of inhibition to the DA neuron and, when removed, produces a classical disinhibition burst. In contrast, when GABA neurons are synchronized by common synaptic input, their influence evokes additional spikes in the DA neuron, resulting in increased measures of firing and bursting. Distinct from previous mechanisms, the increases were not based on lowered firing rate of the GABA neurons or weaker hyperpolarization by the GABAR synaptic current. This phenomenon was induced by GABA-mediated hyperpolarization of the DA neuron that leads to decreases in intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration, thus reducing the Ca(2+)-dependent potassium (K(+)) current. In this way, the GABA-mediated hyperpolarization replaces Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) current; however, this inhibition is pulsatile, which allows the DA neuron to fire during the rhythmic pauses in inhibition. Our results emphasize the importance of inhibition in the VTA, which has been discussed in many studies, and suggest a novel mechanism whereby computations can occur locally.",

        "abstract":"Activation of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels is controlled by both cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and membrane potential. To study the mechanism of voltage-dependent gating, we examined mSlo Ca(2+)-activated K(+) currents in excised macropatches from Xenopus oocytes in the virtual absence of Ca(2+) (<1 nM). In response to a voltage step, I(K) activates with an exponential time course, following a brief delay. The delay suggests that rapid transitions precede channel opening. The later exponential time course suggests that activation also involves a slower rate-limiting step. However, the time constant of I(K) relaxation [\u03c4(I(K))] exhibits a complex voltage dependence that is inconsistent with models that contain a single rate limiting step. \u03c4(I(K)) increases weakly with voltage from \u2212500 to \u221220 mV, with an equivalent charge (z) of only 0.14 e, and displays a stronger voltage dependence from +30 to +140 mV (z = 0.49 e), which then decreases from +180 to +240 mV (z = \u22120.29 e). Similarly, the steady state G(K)\u2013V relationship exhibits a maximum voltage dependence (z = 2 e) from 0 to +100 mV, and is weakly voltage dependent (z \u2245 0.4 e) at more negative voltages, where P (o) = 10(\u22125)\u201310(\u22126). These results can be understood in terms of a gating scheme where a central transition between a closed and an open conformation is allosterically regulated by the state of four independent and identical voltage sensors. In the absence of Ca(2+), this allosteric mechanism results in a gating scheme with five closed (C) and five open (O) states, where the majority of the channel's voltage dependence results from rapid C\u2013C and O\u2013O transitions, whereas the C\u2013O transitions are rate limiting and weakly voltage dependent. These conclusions not only provide a framework for interpreting studies of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel voltage gating, but also have important implications for understanding the mechanism of Ca(2+) sensitivity.",

During the acute-stage of spinal cord injury (SCI), the endogenous ability to generate plateaus is lost; however, during the chronic-stage of SCI, plateau potentials reappear with prolonged self-sustained firing that has been implicated in the development of spasticity. In this work, we extend previous modeling studies to systematically investigate the mechanisms underlying the generation of plateau potentials in motoneurons, including the influences of specific ionic currents, the morphological characteristics of the soma and dendrite, and the interactions between persistent inward currents and synaptic input. In particular, the goal of these computational studies is to explore the possible interactions between morphological and electrophysiological changes that occur after incomplete SCI. Model results predict that some of the morphological changes generally associated with the chronic-stage for some types of spinal cord injuries can cause a decrease in self-sustained firing. This and other computational results presented here suggest that the observed increases in self-sustained firing following some types of SCI may occur mainly due to changes in membrane conductances and changes in synaptic activity, particularly changes in the strength and timing of inhibition.",

        "abstract":"Transduction of graded synaptic input into trains of all-or-none action potentials (spikes) is a crucial step in neural coding. Hodgkin identified three classes of neurons with qualitatively different analog-to-digital transduction properties. Despite widespread use of this classification scheme, a generalizable explanation of its biophysical basis has not been described. We recorded from spinal sensory neurons representing each class and reproduced their transduction properties in a minimal model. With phase plane and bifurcation analysis, each class of excitability was shown to derive from distinct spike initiating dynamics. Excitability could be converted between all three classes by varying single parameters; moreover, several parameters, when varied one at a time, had functionally equivalent effects on excitability. From this, we conclude that the spike-initiating dynamics associated with each of Hodgkin's classes represent different outcomes in a nonlinear competition between oppositely directed, kinetically mismatched currents. Class 1 excitability occurs through a saddle node on invariant circle bifurcation when net current at perithreshold potentials is inward (depolarizing) at steady state. Class 2 excitability occurs through a Hopf bifurcation when, despite net current being outward (hyperpolarizing) at steady state, spike initiation occurs because inward current activates faster than outward current. Class 3 excitability occurs through a quasi-separatrix crossing when fast-activating inward current overpowers slow-activating outward current during a stimulus transient, although slow-activating outward current dominates during constant stimulation. Experiments confirmed that different classes of spinal lamina I neurons express the subthreshold currents predicted by our simulations and, further, that those currents are necessary for the excitability in each cell class. Thus, our results demonstrate that all three classes of excitability arise from a continuum in the direction and magnitude of subthreshold currents. Through detailed analysis of the spike-initiating process, we have explained a fundamental link between biophysical properties and qualitative differences in how neurons encode sensory input.",

Touch through facial whiskers is important during these activities, but the close quarters makes whisker deployment challenging. The diverse shapes of facial whiskers reflect distinct ecological niches. Rodent whiskers are conical, often with a remarkably linear taper. Here we use theoretical and experimental methods to analyze interactions of mouse whiskers with objects. When pushed into objects, conical whiskers suddenly slip at a critical angle. In contrast, cylindrical whiskers do not slip for biologically plausible movements. Conical whiskers sweep across objects and textures in characteristic sequences of brief sticks and slips, which provide information about the tactile world. In contrast, cylindrical whiskers stick and remain stuck, even when sweeping across fine textures. Thus the conical whisker structure is adaptive for sensor mobility in constrained environments and in feature extraction during active haptic exploration of objects and surfaces.

Ca(2+)- activated K(+) currents (I (K[Ca])) of cultured\nhuman cardiac fibroblasts were characterized in this study. In\nwhole-cell configuration, depolarizing pulses evoked I (K(Ca)) in an\noutward rectification in these cells, the amplitude of which was\nsuppressed by paxilline (1 microM) or iberiotoxin (200 nM). A\nlarge-conductance, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) channel with\nsingle-channel conductance of 162 +\/- 8 pS was also observed in human\ncardiac fibroblasts. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of\nalpha- subunit of BK(Ca) channels. The dynamic Luo-Rudy model was\napplied to predict cell behavior during direct electrical coupling of\ncardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. In the simulation,\nelectrically coupled cardiac fibroblasts also exhibited action\npotential; however, they were electrically inert with no\ngap-junctional coupling. The simulation predicts that changes in gap\njunction coupling conductance can influence the configuration of\ncardiac action potential and cardiomyocyte excitability. I(K(Ca)) can\nbe elicited by simulated action potential waveforms of cardiac\nfibroblasts when they are electrically coupled to cardiomyocytes. This\nstudy demonstrates that a BK(Ca) channel is functionally expressed in\nhuman cardiac fibroblasts. The activity of these BK(Ca) channels\npresent in human cardiac fibroblasts may contribute to the functional\nactivities of heart cells through transfer of electrical signals\nbetween these two cell types.\n\n-------\n\nTo run the models:\nXPP: start with the command\nxpp ode\\LRd01.ode\n\nTo press (I)nitial and (L)ast 3-4 times, then change parameter (Par)\nperiod from 200 to 500 msec.

        "abstract":"During wakefulness, pyramidal neurons in the intact brain are bombarded by synaptic input that causes tonic depolarization, increased membrane conductance (i.e., shunting), and noisy fluctuations in membrane potential; by comparison, pyramidal neurons in acute slices typically experience little background input. Such differences in operating conditions can compromise extrapolation of in vitro data to explain neuronal operation in vivo. For instance, pyramidal neurons have been identified as integrators (i.e., class 1 neurons according to Hodgkin's classification of intrinsic excitability) based on in vitro experiments but that classification is inconsistent with the ability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to oscillate\/resonate at theta frequency since intrinsic oscillatory behavior is limited to class 2 neurons. Using long depolarizing stimuli and dynamic clamp to reproduce in vivo-like conditions in slice experiments, we show that CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells switch from integrators to resonators, i.e., from class 1 to class 2 excitability. The switch is explained by increased outward current contributed by the M-type potassium current I(M), which shifts the balance of inward and outward currents active at perithreshold potentials and thereby converts the spike-initiating mechanism as predicted by dynamical analysis of our computational model. Perithreshold activation of I(M) is enhanced by the depolarizing shift in spike threshold caused by shunting and\/or sodium channel inactivation secondary to tonic depolarization. Our conclusions were validated by multiple comparisons between simulation and experimental data. Thus even so-called \u201cintrinsic\u201d properties may differ qualitatively between in vitro and in vivo conditions.",

They have complex internal dynamics, which allow them to fire spontaneously, display bistability, and also to be involved in network phenomena such as high frequency oscillations and travelling waves. Purkinje cells exhibit type II excitability, which can be revealed by a discontinuity in their f-I curves. We show that this excitability mechanism allows Purkinje cells to be efficiently inhibited by noise of a particular variance, a phenomenon known as inverse stochastic resonance (ISR). While ISR has been described in theoretical models of single neurons, here we provide the first experimental evidence for this effect. We find that an adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model fitted to the basic Purkinje cell characteristics using a modified dynamic IV method displays ISR and bistability between the resting state and a repetitive activity limit cycle. ISR allows the Purkinje cell to operate in different functional regimes: the all-or-none toggle or the linear filter mode, depending on the variance of the synaptic input. We propose that synaptic noise allows Purkinje cells to quickly switch between these functional regimes. Using mutual information analysis, we demonstrate that ISR can lead to a locally optimal information transfer between the input and output spike train of the Purkinje cell. These results provide the first experimental evidence for ISR and suggest a functional role for ISR in cerebellar information processing.",

Besides the direct coupling, anatomical evidence indicates that the cerebral cortex and thalamus also communicate indirectly through an important intermediate bridge\u2013basal ganglia. It has been thus postulated that the basal ganglia might play key roles in the modulation of absence seizures, but the relevant biophysical mechanisms are still not completely established. Using a biophysically based model, we demonstrate here that the typical absence seizure activities can be controlled and modulated by the direct GABAergic projections from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to either the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) or the specific relay nuclei (SRN) of thalamus, through different biophysical mechanisms. Under certain conditions, these two types of seizure control are observed to coexist in the same network. More importantly, due to the competition between the inhibitory SNr-TRN and SNr-SRN pathways, we find that both decreasing and increasing the activation of SNr neurons from the normal level may considerably suppress the generation of spike-and-slow wave discharges in the coexistence region. Overall, these results highlight the bidirectional functional roles of basal ganglia in controlling and modulating absence seizures, and might provide novel insights into the therapeutic treatments of this brain disorder.",

Methods: With the aid of patch-clamp technology and simulation modeling, the effects of Rot on membrane ion currents present in mHippoE-14 cells were investigated. Results: Addition of Rot produced an inhibitory action on the peak amplitude of INa with an IC50 value of 39.3 uM; however, neither activation nor inactivation kinetics of INa was changed during cell exposure to this compound. Addition of Rot produced little or no modifications in the steady-state inactivation curve of INa. Rot increased the amplitude of Ca2+-activated Cl- current in response to membrane depolarization with an EC50 value of 35.4 uM; further addition of niflumic acid reversed Rot-mediated stimulation of this current. Moreover, when these cells were exposed to 10 uM Rot, a specific population of ATP-sensitive K+ channels with a single-channel conductance of 18.1 pS was measured, despite its inability to alter single-channel conductance. Under current clamp condition, the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials in mHippoE-14 cells was significantly raised in the presence of Rot (10 uM) with no changes in their amplitude and time course of rise and decay. In simulated model of hippocampal neurons incorporated with chemical autaptic connection, increased autaptic strength to mimic the action of Rot was noted to change the bursting pattern with emergence of subthreshold potentials. Conclusions: The Rot effects presented herein might exert a significant action on functional activities of hippocampal neurons occurring in vivo.\n\n\n\nTo run the model:  \n\nXPP: start with the command  \n\nxpp ode\\Rotenone\\_ChemAut  \n\nMouse click on Initialconds, and then (G)o.\nThis will make a trace similar to Fig. 6Ba.\n\n!",

        "abstract":"Astrocytes, a glial cell type of the central nervous system, have emerged as detectors and regulators of neuronal information processing. Astrocyte excitability resides in transient variations of free cytosolic calcium concentration over a range of temporal and spatial scales, from sub-microdomains to waves propagating throughout the cell. Despite extensive experimental approaches, it is not clear how these signals are transmitted to and integrated within an astrocyte. The localization of the main molecular actors and the geometry of the system, including the spatial organization of calcium channels IP(3)R, are deemed essential. However, as most calcium signals occur in astrocytic ramifications that are too fine to be resolved by conventional light microscopy, most of those spatial data are unknown and computational modeling remains the only methodology to study this issue. Here, we propose an IP(3)R-mediated calcium signaling model for dynamics in such small sub-cellular volumes. To account for the expected stochasticity and low copy numbers, our model is both spatially explicit and particle-based. Extensive simulations show that spontaneous calcium signals arise in the model via the interplay between excitability and stochasticity. The model reproduces the main forms of calcium signals and indicates that their frequency crucially depends on the spatial organization of the IP(3)R channels. Importantly, we show that two processes expressing exactly the same calcium channels can display different types of calcium signals depending on the spatial organization of the channels. Our model with realistic process volume and calcium concentrations successfully reproduces spontaneous calcium signals that we measured in calcium micro-domains with confocal microscopy and predicts that local variations of calcium indicators might contribute to the diversity of calcium signals observed in astrocytes. To our knowledge, this model is the first model suited to investigate calcium dynamics in fine astrocytic processes and to propose plausible mechanisms responsible for their variability.",

        "abstract":"Neuropathic pain remains notoriously difficult to treat despite numerous drug targets. Here, we offer a novel explanation for this intractability. Computer simulations predicted that qualitative changes in primary afferent excitability linked to neuropathic pain arise through a switch in spike initiation dynamics when molecular pathologies reach a tipping point (criticality), and that this tipping point can be reached via several different molecular pathologies (degeneracy). We experimentally tested these predictions by pharmacologically blocking native conductances and\/or electrophysiologically inserting virtual conductances. Multiple different manipulations successfully reproduced or reversed neuropathic changes in primary afferents from na\u00efve or nerve-injured rats, respectively, thus confirming the predicted criticality and its degenerate basis. Degeneracy means that several different molecular pathologies are individually sufficient to cause hyperexcitability, and because several such pathologies co-occur after nerve injury, that no single pathology is uniquely necessary. Consequently, single-target-drugs can be circumvented by maladaptive plasticity in any one of several ion channels. DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.02370.001",

        "abstract":"The classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model neglects the time-dependence of ion concentrations in spiking dynamics. The dynamics is therefore limited to a time scale of milliseconds, which is determined by the membrane capacitance multiplied by the resistance of the ion channels, and by the gating time constants. We study slow dynamics in an extended HH framework that includes time-dependent ion concentrations, pumps, and buffers. Fluxes across the neuronal membrane change intra- and extracellular ion concentrations, whereby the latter can also change through contact to reservoirs in the surroundings. Ion gain and loss of the system is identified as a bifurcation parameter whose essential importance was not realized in earlier studies. Our systematic study of the bifurcation structure and thus the phase space structure helps to understand activation and inhibition of a new excitability in ion homeostasis which emerges in such extended models. Also modulatory mechanisms that regulate the spiking rate can be explained by bifurcations. The dynamics on three distinct slow times scales is determined by the cell volume-to-surface-area ratio and the membrane permeability (seconds), the buffer time constants (tens of seconds), and the slower backward buffering (minutes to hours). The modulatory dynamics and the newly emerging excitable dynamics corresponds to pathological conditions observed in epileptiform burst activity, and spreading depression in migraine aura and stroke, respectively.",

        "abstract":"Studying ion channel currents generated distally from the recording site is difficult because of artifacts caused by poor space clamp and membrane filtering. A computational model can quantify artifact parameters for correction by simulating the currents only if their exact anatomical location is known. We propose that the same artifacts that confound current recordings can help pinpoint the source of those currents by providing a signature of the neuron\u2019s morphology. This method can improve the recording quality of currents initiated at the spike initiation zone (SIZ) that are often distal to the soma in invertebrate neurons. Drosophila being a valuable tool for characterizing ion currents, we estimated the SIZ location and quantified artifacts in an identified motoneuron, aCC\/MN1-Ib, by constructing a novel multicompartmental model. Initial simulation of the measured biophysical channel properties in an isopotential Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron model partially replicated firing characteristics. Adding a second distal compartment, which contained spike-generating Na(+) and K(+) currents, was sufficient to simulate aCC\u2019s in vivo activity signature. Matching this signature using a reconstructed morphology predicted that the SIZ is on aCC\u2019s primary axon, 70 \u03bcm after the most distal dendritic branching point. From SIZ to soma, we observed and quantified selective morphological filtering of fast activating currents. Non-inactivating K(+) currents are filtered \u223c3 times less and despite their large magnitude at the soma they could be as distal as Na(+) currents. The peak of transient component (NaT) of the voltage-activated Na(+) current is also filtered more than the magnitude of slower persistent component (NaP), which can contribute to seizures. The corrected NaP\/NaT ratio explains the previously observed discrepancy when the same channel is expressed in different cells. In summary, we used an in vivo signature to estimate ion channel location and recording artifacts, which can be applied to other neurons.",

        "abstract":"The calcium\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in the induction of long-term postsynaptic modifications following calcium entry. Experiments suggest that these long-term synaptic changes are all-or-none switch-like events between discrete states. The biochemical network involving CaMKII and its regulating protein signaling cascade has been hypothesized to durably maintain the evoked synaptic state in the form of a bistable switch. However, it is still unclear whether experimental LTP\/LTD protocols lead to corresponding transitions between the two states in realistic models of such a network. We present a detailed biochemical model of the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the CaMKII dephosphorylation. As previously shown, two stable states of the CaMKII phosphorylation level exist at resting intracellular calcium concentration, and high calcium transients can switch the system from the weakly phosphorylated (DOWN) to the highly phosphorylated (UP) state of the CaMKII (similar to a LTP event). We show here that increased CaMKII dephosphorylation activity at intermediate Ca(2+) concentrations can lead to switching from the UP to the DOWN state (similar to a LTD event). This can be achieved if protein phosphatase activity promoting CaMKII dephosphorylation activates at lower Ca(2+) levels than kinase activity. Finally, it is shown that the CaMKII system can qualitatively reproduce results of plasticity outcomes in response to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and presynaptic stimulation protocols. This shows that the CaMKII protein network can account for both induction, through LTP\/LTD-like transitions, and storage, due to its bistability, of synaptic changes.",

This nucleus is more than a simple relay, however, because rNST neurons differ in response rates and tuning curves relative to primary afferent fibers. To systematically study the impact of convergence and inhibition on firing frequency and breadth of tuning (BOT) in rNST, we constructed a mathematical model of its two major cell types: projection neurons and inhibitory neurons. First, we fit a conductance-based neuronal model to data derived from whole cell patch-clamp recordings of inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons in a mouse expressing Venus under the control of the VGAT promoter. We then used in vivo chorda tympani (CT) taste responses as afferent input to modeled neurons and assessed how the degree and type of convergence influenced model cell output frequency and BOT for comparison with in vivo gustatory responses from the rNST. Finally, we assessed how presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition impacted model cell output. The results of our simulations demonstrated 1) increasing numbers of convergent afferents (2\u201310) result in a proportional increase in best-stimulus firing frequency but only a modest increase in BOT, 2) convergence of afferent input selected from the same best-stimulus class of CT afferents produced a better fit to real data from the rNST compared with convergence of randomly selected afferent input, and 3) inhibition narrowed the BOT to more realistically model the in vivo rNST data. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro neurophysiology together with conductance-based modeling, we show how patterns of convergence and inhibition interact in the rostral (gustatory) solitary nucleus to maintain signal fidelity. Although increasing convergence led to a systematic increase in firing frequency, tuning specificity was maintained with a pattern of afferent inputs sharing the best-stimulus compared with random inputs. Tonic inhibition further enhanced response fidelity.",

In this paper, we develop the first computational framework that combines the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley type spiking dynamics, dynamic ion concentrations and glutamate homeostasis, neuronal and astroglial volume changes, and ion exchange with vasculature into a comprehensive model to elucidate the role of glutamate uptake in the dynamics of spreading depolarization (SD)\u2014the electrophysiological event underlying numerous pathologies including migraine, ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hematoma, and trauma. We are particularly interested in investigating the role of glutamate in the duration and termination of SD caused by K(+) perfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results demonstrate that glutamate signaling plays a key role in the dynamics of SD, and that impaired glutamate uptake leads to recovery failure of neurons from SD. We confirm predictions from our model experimentally by showing that inhibiting astrocytic glutamate uptake using TFB-TBOA nearly quadruples the duration of SD in layers 2-3 of visual cortical slices from juvenile rats. The model equations are either derived purely from first physical principles of electroneutrality, osmosis, and conservation of particles or a combination of these principles and known physiological facts.

        "abstract":"Spasticity is commonly observed after chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and many other central nervous system disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke). SCI-induced spasticity has been associated with motoneuron hyperexcitability partly due to enhanced activation of intrinsic persistent inward currents (PICs). Disrupted spinal inhibitory mechanisms also have been implicated. Altered inhibition can result from complex changes in the strength, kinetics, and reversal potential (E(Cl(\u2212))) of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) and glycine receptor currents. Development of optimal therapeutic strategies requires an understanding of the impact of these interacting factors on motoneuron excitability. We employed computational methods to study the effects of conductance, kinetics, and E(Cl(\u2212)) of a dendritic inhibition on PIC activation and motoneuron discharge. A two-compartment motoneuron with enhanced PICs characteristic of SCI and receiving recurrent inhibition from Renshaw cells was utilized in these simulations. This dendritic inhibition regulated PIC onset and offset and exerted its strongest effects at motoneuron recruitment and in the secondary range of the current-frequency relationship during PIC activation. Increasing inhibitory conductance compensated for moderate depolarizing shifts in E(Cl(\u2212)) by limiting PIC activation and self-sustained firing. Furthermore, GABA(A) currents exerted greater control on PIC activation than glycinergic currents, an effect attributable to their slower kinetics. These results suggest that modulation of the strength and kinetics of GABA(A) currents could provide treatment strategies for uncontrollable spasms.",

Three reduced computational models that simulate eupnoeic and vagotomized respiratory rhythms are considered. All models exhibit the emergence of respiratory perturbations associated with Rett syndrome as inhibition to the KFn is diminished. Simulations suggest that application of 5\u2010HT(1A) agonists can mitigate the respiratory pathology. The three models can be distinguished and tested based on their predictions about connections and dynamics within the respiratory circuit and about effects of perturbations on certain respiratory neuron populations. ABSTRACT: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a developmental disorder that can lead to respiratory disturbances featuring prolonged apnoeas of variable durations. Determining the mechanisms underlying these effects at the level of respiratory neural circuits would have significant implications for treatment efforts and would also enhance our understanding of respiratory rhythm generation and control. While experimental studies have suggested possible factors contributing to the respiratory patterns of RTT, we take a novel computational approach to the investigation of RTT, which allows for direct manipulation of selected system parameters and testing of specific hypotheses. Specifically, we present three reduced computational models, developed using an established framework, all of which successfully simulate respiratory outputs across eupnoeic and vagotomized conditions. All three models show that loss of inhibition to the K\u00f6lliker\u2010Fuse nucleus reproduces the key respiratory alterations associated with RTT and, as suggested experimentally, that effects of 5\u2010HT(1A) agonists on the respiratory neural circuit suffice to alleviate this respiratory pathology. Each of the models makes distinct predictions regarding the neuronal populations and interactions underlying these effects, suggesting natural directions for future experimental testing.",

        "abstract":"In the basal ganglia, focused rhythmicity is an important feature of network activity at certain stages of motor processing. In disease, however, the basal ganglia develop amplified rhythmicity. Here, we demonstrate how the cellular architecture and network dynamics of an inhibitory loop in the basal ganglia yield exaggerated synchrony and locking to \u03b2 oscillations, specifically in the dopamine-depleted state. A key component of this loop is the pallidostriatal pathway, a well-characterized anatomical projection whose function has long remained obscure. We present a synaptic characterization of this pathway in mice and incorporate these data into a computational model that we use to investigate its influence over striatal activity under simulated healthy and dopamine-depleted conditions. Our model predicts that the pallidostriatal pathway influences striatal output preferentially during periods of synchronized activity within GPe. We show that, under dopamine-depleted conditions, this effect becomes a key component of a positive feedback loop between the GPe and striatum that promotes synchronization and rhythmicity. Our results generate novel predictions about the role of the pallidostriatal pathway in shaping basal ganglia activity in health and disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This work demonstrates that functional connections from the globus pallidus externa (GPe) to striatum are substantially stronger onto fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) than onto medium spiny neurons. Our circuit model suggests that when GPe spikes are synchronous, this pallidostriatal pathway causes synchronous FSI activity pauses, which allow a transient window of disinhibition for medium spiny neurons. In simulated dopamine-depletion, this GPe-FSI activity is necessary for the emergence of strong synchronization and the amplification and propagation of \u03b2 oscillations, which are a hallmark of parkinsonian circuit dysfunction. These results suggest that GPe may play a central role in propagating abnormal circuit activity to striatum, which in turn projects to downstream basal ganglia structures. These findings warrant further exploration of GPe as a target for interventions for Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract":"Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition in which a basal brain hyperexcitability results in paroxysmal hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. Human temporal lobe epilepsy has been associated with dysfunction or loss of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 in a subset of pyramidal cells in the subiculum, a key structure generating epileptic activities. KCC2 regulates intraneuronal chloride and extracellular potassium levels by extruding both ions. Absence of effective KCC2 may alter the dynamics of chloride and potassium levels during repeated activation of GABAergic synapses due to interneuron activity. In turn, such GABAergic stress may itself affect Cl(\u2212) regulation. Such changes in ionic homeostasis may switch GABAergic signaling from inhibitory to excitatory in affected pyramidal cells and also increase neuronal excitability. Possibly these changes contribute to periodic bursting in pyramidal cells, an essential component in the onset of ictal epileptic events. We tested this hypothesis with a computational model of a subicular network with realistic connectivity. The pyramidal cell model explicitly incorporated the cotransporter KCC2 and its effects on the internal\/external chloride and potassium levels. Our network model suggested the loss of KCC2 in a critical number of pyramidal cells increased external potassium and intracellular chloride concentrations leading to seizure-like field potential oscillations. These oscillations included transient discharges leading to ictal-like field events with frequency spectra as in vitro. Restoration of KCC2 function suppressed seizure activity and thus may present a useful therapeutic option. These simulations therefore suggest that reduced KCC2 cotransporter activity alone may underlie the generation of ictal discharges. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ion regulation in the brain is a major determinant of neural excitability. Intracellular chloride in neurons, a partial determinant of the resting potential and the inhibitory reversal potentials, is regulated together with extracellular potassium via kation chloride cotransporters. During temporal lobe epilepsy, the homeostatic regulation of intracellular chloride is impaired in pyramidal cells, yet how this dysregulation may lead to seizures has not been explored. Using a realistic neural network model describing ion mechanisms, we show that chloride homeostasis pathology provokes seizure activity analogous to recordings from epileptogenic brain tissue. We show that there is a critical percentage of pathological cells required for seizure initiation. Our model predicts that restoration of the chloride homeostasis in pyramidal cells could be a viable antiepileptic strategy.",

        "abstract":"Pain caused by nerve injury (i.e. neuropathic pain) is associated with development of neuronal hyperexcitability at several points along the pain pathway. Within primary afferents, numerous injury-induced changes have been identified but it remains unclear which molecular changes are necessary and sufficient to explain cellular hyperexcitability. To investigate this, we built computational models that reproduce the switch from a normal spiking pattern characterized by a single spike at the onset of depolarization to a neuropathic one characterized by repetitive spiking throughout depolarization. Parameter changes that were sufficient to switch the spiking pattern also enabled membrane potential oscillations and bursting, suggesting that all three pathological changes are mechanistically linked. Dynamical analysis confirmed this prediction by showing that excitability changes co-develop when the nonlinear mechanism responsible for spike initiation switches from a quasi-separatrix-crossing to a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. This switch stems from biophysical changes that bias competition between oppositely directed fast- and slow-activating conductances operating at subthreshold potentials. Competition between activation and inactivation of a single conductance can be similarly biased with equivalent consequences for excitability. \u201cBias\u201d can arise from a multitude of molecular changes occurring alone or in combination; in the latter case, changes can add or offset one another. Thus, our results identify pathological change in the nonlinear interaction between processes affecting spike initiation as the critical determinant of how simple injury-induced changes at the molecular level manifest complex excitability changes at the cellular level. We demonstrate that multiple distinct molecular changes are sufficient to produce neuropathic changes in excitability; however, given that nerve injury elicits numerous molecular changes that may be individually sufficient to alter spike initiation, our results argue that no single molecular change is necessary to produce neuropathic excitability. This deeper understanding of degenerate causal relationships has important implications for how we understand and treat neuropathic pain.",

A model motoneuron pool consisting of 10 motoneurons was constructed using a recently developed two-compartment modeling approach that reflected key cell type-associated properties experimentally identified. The dendritic excitability and firing output depended systematically on both the PIC location and the motoneuron type. The PIC onset and offset in the current-voltage (I-V) relationship tended to occur at more hyperpolarized voltages as the path length to the PIC channels from the soma increased and as the cell type shifted from high- to low-threshold motoneurons. At the same time, the firing acceleration and frequency hysteresis in the frequency-current (F-I) relationship became faster and larger, respectively. However, the PIC onset-offset hysteresis increased as the path length and the recruitment threshold increased. Furthermore, the gain of frequency-current function before full PIC activation was larger for PIC channels located over distal dendritic regions in low- compared with high-threshold motoneurons. When compared with previously published experimental observations, the modeling concurred when Ca-PIC channels were placed closer to the soma in high- than low-threshold motoneurons in the model motoneuron pool. All of these results suggest that the negative relationship of Ca-PIC location and cell recruitment threshold may underlie the systematic variation in I-V and F-I transformation across the motoneuron pool.\n\n\n\nThe direct comparison between the anatomical and reduced motoneuron model has been made for FR-type alpha-motoneuron while varying the distance (i.e., Dpath) to the dendritic site of Ca-PIC from the soma in our previous study: 2014 PLOS ONE (Kim, Jones and Heckman).

        "abstract":"Continuation of spiking after a stimulus ends (i.e. persistent spiking) is thought to support working memory. Muscarinic receptor activation enables persistent spiking among synaptically isolated pyramidal neurons in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but a detailed characterization of that spiking is lacking and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the rate of persistent spiking in ACC neurons is insensitive to the intensity and number of triggers, but can be modulated by injected current, and that persistent spiking can resume after several seconds of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging in brain slices from male rats, we determined that canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are necessary for persistent spiking and that TRPC-activating calcium enters in a spike-dependent manner via voltage-gated calcium channels. Constrained by these biophysical details, we built a computational model that reproduced the observed pattern of persistent spiking. Nonlinear dynamical analysis of that model revealed that TRPC channels become fully activated by the small rise in intracellular calcium caused by evoked spikes. Calcium continues to rise during persistent spiking, but because TRPC channel activation saturates, firing rate stabilizes. By calcium rising higher than required for maximal TRPC channel activation, TRPC channels are able to remain active during periods of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence (until calcium drops below saturating levels) such that persistent spiking can resume when hyperpolarization is discontinued. Our results thus reveal that the robust intrinsic bistability exhibited by ACC neurons emerges from the nonlinear positive feedback relationship between spike-dependent calcium influx and TRPC channel activation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons use action potentials, or spikes, to encode information. Some neurons can store information for short periods (seconds to minutes) by continuing to spike after a stimulus ends, thus enabling working memory. This so-called \u201cpersistent\u201d spiking occurs in many brain areas and has been linked to activation of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. However, TRPC activation alone is insufficient to explain many aspects of persistent spiking such as resumption of spiking after periods of imposed quiescence. Using experiments and simulations, we show that calcium influx caused by spiking is necessary and sufficient to activate TRPC channels and that the ensuing positive feedback interaction between intracellular calcium and TRPC channel activation can account for many hitherto unexplained aspects of persistent spiking.",

        "abstract":"Sesamin (SSM) and sesamolin (SesA) are the two major furofuran lignans of sesame oil and they have been previously noticed to exert various biological actions. However, their modulatory actions on different types of ionic currents in electrically excitable cells remain largely unresolved. The present experiments were undertaken to explore the possible perturbations of SSM and SesA on different types of ionic currents, e.g., voltage-gated Na(+) currents (I(Na)), erg-mediated K(+) currents (I(K(erg))), M-type K(+) currents (I(K(M))), delayed-rectifier K(+) currents (I(K(DR))) and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (I(h)) identified from pituitary tumor (GH(3)) cells. The exposure to SSM or SesA depressed the transient and late components of I(Na) with different potencies. The IC(50) value of SSM needed to lessen the peak or sustained I(Na) was calculated to be 7.2 or 0.6 \u03bcM, while that of SesA was 9.8 or 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively. The dissociation constant of SSM-perturbed inhibition on I(Na), based on the first-order reaction scheme, was measured to be 0.93 \u03bcM, a value very similar to the IC(50) for its depressant action on sustained I(Na). The addition of SSM was also effective at suppressing the amplitude of resurgent I(Na). The addition of SSM could concentration-dependently inhibit the I(K(M)) amplitude with an IC(50) value of 4.8 \u03bcM. SSM at a concentration of 30 \u03bcM could suppress the amplitude of I(K(erg)), while at 10 \u03bcM, it mildly decreased the I(K(DR)) amplitude. However, the addition of neither SSM (10 \u03bcM) nor SesA (10 \u03bcM) altered the amplitude or kinetics of I(h) in response to long-lasting hyperpolarization. Additionally, in this study, a modified Markovian model designed for SCN8A-encoded (or Na(V)1.6) channels was implemented to evaluate the plausible modifications of SSM on the gating kinetics of Na(V) channels. The model demonstrated herein was well suited to predict that the SSM-mediated decrease in peak I(Na), followed by increased current inactivation, which could largely account for its favorable decrease in the probability of the open-blocked over open state of Na(V) channels. Collectively, our study provides evidence that highlights the notion that SSM or SesA could block multiple ion currents, such as I(Na) and I(K(M)), and suggests that these actions are potentially important and may participate in the functional activities of various electrically excitable cells in vivo.",

        "abstract":"Low frequency firing is modeled by Type 1 neurons with a SNIC, but, because of the vertical slope of the square-root-like f\u2013I curve, low f only occurs over a narrow range of I. When an adaptive current is added, however, the f\u2013I curve is linearized, and low f occurs robustly over a large I range. Ermentrout (Neural Comput. 10(7):1721-1729, 1998) showed that this feature of adaptation paradoxically arises from the SNIC that is responsible for the vertical slope. We show, using a simplified Hindmarsh\u2013Rose neuron with negative feedback acting directly on the adaptation current, that whereas a SNIC contributes to linearization, in practice linearization over a large interval may require strong adaptation strength. We also find that a type 2 neuron with threshold generated by a Hopf bifurcation can also show linearization if adaptation strength is strong. Thus, a SNIC is not necessary. More fundamental than a SNIC is stretching the steep region near threshold, which stems from sufficiently strong adaptation, though a SNIC contributes if present. In a more realistic conductance-based model, Morris\u2013Lecar, with negative feedback acting on the adaptation conductance, an additional assumption that the driving force of the adaptation current is independent of I is needed. If this holds, strong adaptive conductance is both necessary and sufficient for linearization of f\u2013I curves of type 2 f\u2013I curves.",

Modeling revealed two potential mechanisms for the drop in accumbal dopamine efflux evoked by the selective \u03b17 partial agonist TC-7020. TC-7020 could desensitize \u03b17 NNRs located predominantly on dopamine neurons or glutamatergic afferents to them or, alternatively, activate \u03b17 NNRs located on the glutamatergic afferents to GABAergic interneurons in the ventral tegmental area. Only the model based on desensitization, however, was able to explain the neutralizing effect of coapplied PNU-120596, a positive allosteric modulator. According to our results, the most likely sites of action are the preterminal \u03b17 NNRs controlling glutamate release from cortical afferents to the nucleus accumbens.

        "abstract":"Suppression of excessively synchronous beta-band oscillatory activity in the brain is believed to suppress hypokinetic motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Recently, a lot of interest has been devoted to desynchronizing delayed feedback deep brain stimulation (DBS). This type of synchrony control was shown to destabilize the synchronized state in networks of simple model oscillators as well as in networks of coupled model neurons. However, the dynamics of the neural activity in Parkinson\u2019s disease exhibits complex intermittent synchronous patterns, far from the idealized synchronous dynamics used to study the delayed feedback stimulation. This study explores the action of delayed feedback stimulation on partially synchronized oscillatory dynamics, similar to what one observes experimentally in parkinsonian patients. We employ a computational model of the basal ganglia networks which reproduces experimentally observed fine temporal structure of the synchronous dynamics. When the parameters of our model are such that the synchrony is unphysiologically strong, the feedback exerts a desynchronizing action. However, when the network is tuned to reproduce the highly variable temporal patterns observed experimentally, the same kind of delayed feedback may actually increase the synchrony. As network parameters are changed from the range which produces complete synchrony to those favoring less synchronous dynamics, desynchronizing delayed feedback may gradually turn into synchronizing stimulation. This suggests that delayed feedback DBS in Parkinson\u2019s disease may boost rather than suppress synchronization and is unlikely to be clinically successful. The study also indicates that delayed feedback stimulation may not necessarily exhibit a desynchronization effect when acting on a physiologically realistic partially synchronous dynamics, and provides an example of how to estimate the stimulation effect.",

        "abstract":"How sensory information influences the dynamics of rhythm generation varies across systems, and general principles for understanding this aspect of motor control are lacking. Determining the origin of respiratory rhythm generation is challenging because the mechanisms in a central circuit considered in isolation may be different from those in the intact organism. We analyze a closed-loop respiratory control model incorporating a central pattern generator (CPG), the Butera-Rinzel-Smith (BRS) model, together with lung mechanics, oxygen handling, and chemosensory components. We show that 1) embedding the BRS model neuron in a control loop creates a bistable system; 2) although closed-loop and open-loop (isolated) CPG systems both support eupnea-like bursting activity, they do so via distinct mechanisms; 3) chemosensory feedback in the closed loop improves robustness to variable metabolic demand; 4) the BRS model conductances provide an autoresuscitation mechanism for recovery from transient interruption of chemosensory feedback; and 5) the in vitro brain stem CPG slice responds to hypoxia with transient bursting that is qualitatively similar to in silico autoresuscitation. Bistability of bursting and tonic spiking in the closed-loop system corresponds to coexistence of eupnea-like breathing, with normal minute ventilation and blood oxygen level and a tachypnea-like state, with pathologically reduced minute ventilation and critically low blood oxygen. Disruption of the normal breathing rhythm, through either imposition of hypoxia or interruption of chemosensory feedback, can push the system from the eupneic state into the tachypneic state. We use geometric singular perturbation theory to analyze the system dynamics at the boundary separating eupnea-like and tachypnea-like outcomes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A common challenge facing rhythmic biological processes is the adaptive regulation of central pattern generator (CPG) activity in response to sensory feedback. We apply dynamical systems tools to understand several properties of a closed-loop respiratory control model, including the coexistence of normal and pathological breathing, robustness to changes in metabolic demand, spontaneous autoresuscitation in response to hypoxia, and the distinct mechanisms that underlie rhythmogenesis in the intact control circuit vs. the isolated, open-loop CPG.",

We sought to develop an in silico AP (isAP) model that provides an assessment of the effect of a compound on the myocyte AP duration (APD) using concentration-effect curve data from a panel of five ICs (hNav1.5, hCav1.2, hKv4.3\/hKChIP2.2, hKv7.1\/hminK, hKv11.1). A test set of 53 compounds was selected to cover a range of selective and mixed IC modulators that were tested for their effects on optically measured APD. A threshold of >10% change in APD at 90% repolarization (APD90) was used to signify an effect at the top test concentration. To capture the variations observed in left ventricular midmyocardial myocyte APD data from 19 different dogs, the isAP model was calibrated to produce an ensemble of 19 model variants that could capture the shape and form of the APs and also quantitatively replicate dofetilide- and diltiazem-induced APD90 changes. Provided with IC panel data only, the isAP model was then used, blinded, to predict APD90 changes greater than 10%. At a simulated concentration of 30 \u00b5M and based on a criterion that six of the variants had to agree, isAP prediction was scored as showing greater than 80% predictivity of compound activity. Thus, early in drug discovery, the isAP model allows integrating separate IC data and is amenable to the throughput required for use as a virtual screen.\n \n\n\n\n The original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n An in silico canine cardiac midmyocardial action potential duration model as a tool for early drug safety assessment, M.

The latter phenomenon often occurs as repetitive Ca2+ spikes. In this study, the effect of the two Ins-1,4,5-P3 metabolizing enzymes (Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase) on the temporal pattern of Ca2+ oscillations has been investigated. On the basis of the well-documented Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase stimulation by the Ca2+\/calmodulin complex and of the experimentally-determined kinetic characteristics of these enzymes, we predict that 5-phosphatase primarily controls the levels of Ins-1,4,5-P3 and, thereby, the occurrence and frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Consequently, the model reproduces the experimental observation performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells that 5-phosphatase overexpression has a much more pronounced effect on the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations than 3-kinase overexpression. We also investigated, in more detail, under which conditions a similar effect could be observed in other cell types expressing various Ins-1,4,5-P3 3-kinase activities.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n'Simulations of the effects of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase and 5-phosphatase activities on Ca2+ oscillations.', G Dupont, C Erneux, 1997 *Cell Calcium*, 22(5), 321-331.

        "abstract":"[Ca2+]i oscillations have been described in a variety of cells. This study focuses on caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Previous work has shown that these oscillations require Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive store. The aim of the study was to understand the mechanism responsible for the oscillations. As a starting point, [Ca2+]i relaxations were examined after membrane depolarization and exposure to caffeine. For both stimuli, post-stimulus relaxations could be described by the sum of two decaying exponential functions, consistent with a one-pool system in which Ca2+ transport between compartments is regulated by linear Ca2+ pumps and leaks. After modifying the store to include a [Ca2+]i-sensitive leak, the model also exhibits oscillations such as those observed experimentally. The model was tested by comparing measured and predicted net Ca2+ fluxes during the oscillatory cycle. Three independent fluxes were measured, describing the rates of 1) Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, 2) Ca2+ release by the internal store, and 3) Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane and uptake by the internal store. Starting with estimates of the model parameters deduced from post-stimulus relaxations and the rapid upstroke, a set of parameter values was found that provides a good description of [Ca2+]i throughout the oscillatory cycle. With the same parameter values, there was also good agreement between the measured and simulated net fluxes. Thus, a one-pool model with a single [Ca2+]i-sensitive Ca2+ permeability is adequate to account for many of the quantitative properties of steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Inactivation of the intracellular Ca2+ permeability, cooperative nonlinear Ca2+ uptake and extrusion mechanisms, and functional links between plasma membrane Ca2+ transport and the internal store are not required.",

Various cell types, including hepatocytes, display Ca2+ oscillations when stimulated by an extracellular signal. However, the biological relevance of this temporal organization remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate theoretically the effect of Ca2+ oscillations on a particular example of cell regulation: the phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation cycle controlling the activation of glycogen phosphorylase in hepatocytes. By modelling periodic sinusoidal variations in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, we show that Ca2+ oscillations reduce the threshold for the activation of the enzyme. Furthermore, as the activation of a given enzyme depends on the kinetics of its phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation cycle, speciality can be encoded by the oscillation frequency. Finally, using a model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations based on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, we show that realistic Ca2+ oscillations can potentiate the response to a hormonal stimulation. These results indicate that Ca2+ oscillations in hepatocytes could contribute to increase the efficiency and speciality of cellular signalling, as shown experimentally for gene expression in lymphocytes (Dolmetsch et al., 1998).\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nActivation of the Liver Glycogen Phosphorylase by Ca2+ Oscillations: \na Theoretical Study', DAVID GALL, ERIKA BAUS, AND GENEVIEEVE DUPONT, 2000 *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 207, 445-454.

The model runs in both COR and OpenCell to replicate the published results (figure 2) with R0=0.8. The units have been checked and they are consistent.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: The class of immunosuppressive lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been identified as a key component in preventing autoimmune diseases. Although Tregs have been incorporated previously in mathematical models of autoimmunity, we take a novel approach which emphasizes the importance of professional antigen presenting cells (pAPCs). We examine three possible mechanisms of Treg action (each in isolation) through ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The immune response against a particular autoantigen is suppressed both by Tregs specific for that antigen and by Tregs of arbitrary specificities, through their action on either maturing or already mature pAPCs or on autoreactive effector T cells. In this deterministic approach, we find that qualitative long-term behaviour is predicted by the basic reproductive ratio R(0) for each system. When R(0) is less tHAN 1, only the trivial equilibrium exists and is stable; when R(0) is greater than 1, this equilibrium loses its stability and a stable non-trivial equilibrium appears. We interpret the absence of self-damaging populations at the trivial equilibrium to imply a state of self-tolerance, and their presence at the non-trivial equilibrium to imply a state of chronic autoimmunity. Irrespective of mechanism, our model predicts that Tregs specific for the autoantigen in question play no role in the system's qualitative long-term behaviour, but have quantitative effects that could potentially reduce an autoimmune response to sub-clinical levels. Our results also suggest an important role for Tregs of arbitrary specificities in modulating the qualitative outcome. A stochastic treatment of the same model demonstrates that the probability of developing a chronic autoimmune response increases with the initial exposure to self antigen or autoreactive effector T cells. The three different mechanisms we consider, while leading to a number of similar predictions, also exhibit key differences in both transient dynamics (ODE approach) and the probability of chronic autoimmunity (stochastic approach).\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nSelf-tolerance and Autoimmunity in a Regulatory T Cell Model, Alexander HK and Wahl LM, 2010, *Bulletin of Mathematical Biology*.

The Lipid Metabolites and Pathways Strategy consortium is actively investigating lipid metabolism in mammalian cells and has made available time-course data on various lipids in response to treatment with KDO(2)-lipid A (a lipopolysaccharide analog) of macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. The lipids known as eicosanoids play an important role in inflammation. We have reconstructed an integrated network of eicosanoid metabolism and signaling based on the KEGG pathway database and the literature and have developed a kinetic model. A matrix-based approach was used to estimate the rate constants from experimental data and these were further refined using generalized constrained nonlinear optimization. The resulting model fits the experimental data well for all species, and simulated enzyme activities were similar to their literature values. The quantitative model for eicosanoid metabolism that we have developed can\u00a0be used to design experimental studies utilizing genetic and pharmacological perturbations to probe fluxes in lipid pathways.",

        "abstract":"The cellular basis of cardiac pacemaking is still debated. Reliable computational models of the sinoatrial node (SAN) action potential (AP) may help gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Recently, novel models incorporating detailed Ca(2+)-handling dynamics have been proposed, but they fail to reproduce a number of experimental data, and more specifically effects of \u2018funny\u2019 (I(f)) current modifications. We therefore developed a SAN AP model, based on available experimental data, in an attempt to reproduce physiological and pharmacological heart rate modulation. Cell compartmentalization and intracellular Ca(2+)-handling mechanisms were formulated as in the Maltsev\u2013Lakatta model, focusing on Ca(2+)-cycling processes. Membrane current equations were revised on the basis of published experimental data. Modifications of the formulation of currents\/pumps\/exchangers to simulate I(f) blockers, autonomic modulators and Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms (ivabradine, caesium, acetylcholine, isoprenaline, BAPTA) were derived from experimental data. The model generates AP waveforms typical of rabbit SAN cells, whose parameters fall within the experimental ranges: 352 ms cycle length, 80 mV AP amplitude, \u221258 mV maximum diastolic potential (MDP), 108 ms APD(50), and 7.1 V s(\u22121) maximum upstroke velocity. Rate modulation by I(f)-blocking drugs agrees with experimental findings: 20% and 22% caesium-induced (5 mm) and ivabradine-induced (3 \u03bcm) rate reductions, respectively, due to changes in diastolic depolarization (DD) slope, with no changes in either MDP or take-off potential (TOP). The model consistently reproduces the effects of autonomic modulation: 20% rate decrease with 10 nm acetylcholine and 28% increase with 1 \u03bcm isoprenaline, again entirely due to increase in the DD slope, with no changes in either MDP or TOP. Model testing of BAPTA effects showed slowing of rate, \u221226%, without cessation of beating. Our up-to-date model describes satisfactorily experimental data concerning autonomic stimulation, funny-channel blockade and inhibition of the Ca(2+)-related system by BAPTA, making it a useful tool for further investigation. Simulation results suggest that a detailed description of the intracellular Ca(2+) fluxes is fully compatible with the observation that I(f) is a major component of pacemaking and rate modulation.",

We examine the role of Bax and Bcl-2 synthesis and degradation rates, as well as the number of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs), on the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Our analysis suggests that cooperative apoptosome formation is a mechanism for inducing bistability, much more robust than that induced by other mechanisms, such as inhibition of caspase-3 by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). Simulations predict a pathological state in which cells will exhibit a monostable cell survival if Bax degradation rate is above a threshold value, or if Bax expression rate is below a threshold value. Otherwise, cell death or survival occur depending on initial caspase-3 levels. We show that high expression rates of Bcl-2 can counteract the effects of Bax. Our simulations also demonstrate a monostable (pathological) apoptotic response if the number of MPTPs exceeds a threshold value.

        "abstract":"The eukaryotic cell cycle is the repeated sequence of events that enable the division of a cell into two daughter cells. It is divided into four phases: G(1), S, G(2), and M. Passage through the cell cycle is strictly regulated by a molecular interaction network, which involves the periodic synthesis and destruction of cyclins that bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases that are present in nonlimiting amounts. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors contribute to cell cycle control. Budding yeast is an established model organism for cell cycle studies, and several mathematical models have been proposed for its cell cycle. An area of major relevance in cell cycle control is the G(1) to S transition. In any given growth condition, it is characterized by the requirement of a specific, critical cell size, P(S), to enter S phase. The molecular basis of this control is still under discussion. The authors report a mathematical model of the G(1) to S network that newly takes into account nucleo\/cytoplasmic localization, the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase Sic1 in facilitating nuclear import of its cognate Cdk1-Clb5, Whi5 control, and carbon source regulation of Sic1 and Sic1-containing complexes. The model was implemented by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the temporal change of the concentration of the involved proteins and protein complexes. The model was tested by simulation in several genetic and nutritional setups and was found to be neatly consistent with experimental data. To estimate P(S), the authors developed a hybrid model including a probabilistic component for firing of DNA replication origins. Sensitivity analysis of P(S) provides a novel relevant conclusion: P(S) is an emergent property of the G(1) to S network that strongly depends on growth rate.",

The model calculates the local changes in the concentrations of free Ca(2+) and of Ca(2+) bound to the major intrinsic myoplasmic Ca(2+) buffers (troponin, ATP, parvalbumin, and the SR Ca(2+) pump) and to the Ca(2+) indicator (fluo-3). A distinctive feature of the model is the inclusion of a binding reaction between fluo-3 and myoplasmic proteins, a process that strongly affects fluo-3\u2032s Ca(2+)-reaction kinetics, its apparent diffusion constant, and hence the morphology of sparks. \u0394F\/F (the change in fluo-3\u2032s fluorescence divided by its resting fluorescence) was estimated from the calculated changes in fluo-3 convolved with the microscope point-spread function. To facilitate comparisons with measured sparks, noise and other sources of variability were included in a random repetitive fashion to generate a large number of simulated sparks that could be analyzed in the same way as the measured sparks. In the initial simulations, the binding of Ca(2+) to the two regulatory sites on troponin was assumed to follow identical and independent binding reactions. These simulations failed to accurately predict the falling phase of the measured sparks. A second set of simulations, which incorporated the idea of positive cooperativity in the binding of Ca(2+) to troponin, produced reasonable agreement with the measurements. Under the assumption that the single channel Ca(2+) current of a ryanodine receptor (RYR) is 0.5\u20132 pA, the results suggest that 1\u20135 active RYRs generate an average Ca(2+) spark in a frog intact muscle fiber.",

        "abstract":"A computational model for the mitochondrial respiratory chain that appropriately balances mass, charge, and free energy transduction is introduced and analyzed based on a previously published set of data measured on isolated cardiac mitochondria. The basic components included in the model are the reactions at complexes I, III, and IV of the electron transport system, ATP synthesis at F(1)F(0) ATPase, substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate\u2013hydrogen co-transporter, and cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the K(+)\/H(+) antiporter and passive H(+) and K(+) permeation. Estimation of 16 adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated from rat heart and liver and observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available data, it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. Specifically, it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.",

The models span from a single compartment, inflexible lung to a single compartment, flexible lung with pulmonary gas exchange. It is shown how the models are related to well-known models in the literature. A long-term purpose of this work is to study nonlinear phenomena seen in the cardio-respiratory system (for example, synchronization between ventilation rate and heart rate, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration). The models developed in this paper can be regarded as the controlled system (plant) and provide a mathematical framework to link between \"molecular-level\", and \"systems-level\" models. It is shown how changes in molecular level affect the alveolar partial pressure. Two assumptions that have previously been made are re-examined: (1) the hidden assumption that the air flow through the mouth is equal to the rate of volume change in the lungs, and, (2) the assumption that the process of oxygen binding to hemoglobin is near equilibrium. Conditions under which these assumptions are valid are studied. All the parameters in the models, except two, are physiologically realistic.

The model has been checked in both COR and PCEnv and it runs to recreate the published results. The units have been checked and they balance. As with the CellML version of the Hund and Rudy 2004 model, on which this particular model is based, a stimulus protocol has been added to allow the model to simulate action potentials for 5 seconds. The parameter 'tissue' has been added to switch between the original (default value 0) and 'tissue' (any other value, for example 1) models.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We have constructed computational models of canine ventricular cells and tissues, ultimately combining detailed tissue architecture and heterogeneous transmural electrophysiology. The heterogeneity is introduced by modifying the Hund-Rudy canine cell model in order to reproduce experimentally reported electrophysiological properties of endocardial, midmyocardial (M) and epicardial cells. These models are validated against experimental data for individual ionic current and action potential characteristics, and their rate dependencies. 1D and 3D heterogeneous virtual tissues are constructed, with detailed tissue architecture (anisotropy and orthotropy, due to fibre orientation and sheet structure) of the left ventricular wall wedge extracted from a diffusion tensor imaging data set. The models are used to study the effects of tissue heterogeneity and class III drugs on transmural propagation and tissue vulnerability to re-entry. We have determined relationships between the transmural dispersion of action potential duration (APD) and the vulnerable window in the 1D virtual ventricular wall, and demonstrated how changes in the transmural heterogeneity, and hence tissue vulnerability, can lead to generation of re-entry in the 3D ventricular wedge. Two class III drugs with opposite qualitative effects on transmural APD heterogeneity are considered: d-sotalol that increases transmural APD dispersion, and amiodarone that decreases it. Simulations with the 1D virtual ventricular wall show that under d-sotalol conditions the vulnerable window is substantially wider compared to amiodarone conditions, primarily in the epicardial region where unidirectional conduction block persists until the adjacent M cells are fully repolarised. Further simulations with the 3D ventricular wedge have shown that ectopic stimulation of the epicardial region results in generation of sustained re-entry under d-sotalol conditions, but not under amiodarone conditions or in control. Again, APD increase in M cells was identified as the major contributor to tissue vulnerability--re-entry was initiated primarily due to ectopic excitation propagating around the unidirectional conduction block in the M cell region. This suggests an electrophysiological mechanism for the anti- and proarrhythmic effects of the class III drugs: the relative safety of amiodarone in comparison to d-sotalol can be explained by relatively low transmural APD dispersion, and hence, a narrow vulnerable window and low probability of re-entry in the tissue.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nThe canine virtual ventricular wall: a platform for dissecting pharmacological effects on propagation and arrhythmogenesis, Alan P.

It is demonstrated that this form of autoinhibition, which is relieved by depolarization, acts as a high-pass filter. This contrasts with vesicle depletion, which acts as a low-pass filter. Model parameters are adjusted to reproduce kinetic slowing data from different Gbetagamma dimeric isoforms, which produce different degrees of slowing. With these sets of parameter values, we demonstrate that the range of frequencies filtered out by the autoinhibition varies greatly depending on the Gbetagamma isoform activated by the autoreceptors. It is shown that G protein autoinhibition can enhance the spatial contrast between a spatially distributed high-frequency signal and surrounding low-frequency noise, providing an alternate mechanism to lateral inhibition. It is also shown that autoinhibition can increase the fidelity of coincidence detection by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the postsynaptic cell. The filter cut, the input frequency below which signals are filtered, depends on several biophysical parameters in addition to those related to Gbetagamma binding and unbinding. By varying one such parameter, the rate at which transmitter unbinds from autoreceptors, we show that the filter cut can be adjusted up or down for several of the Gbetagamma isoforms. This allows for great synapse-to-synapse variability in the distinction between signal and noise.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRole for G Protein G-Beta-Gamma Isoform Specificity in Synaptic Signal Processing: A Computational Study, Richard Bertram, Michelle I.

This is a complex reaction powered by the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which isgenerated by mitochondrial respiration. A detailed model of this reaction, which includes dynamic equations for the key mitochondrialvariables, was developed earlier by Magnus and Keizer. However, this model is extraordinarily complicated. We develop a simpler modelthat captures the behavior of the original model but is easier to use and to understand. We then use it to investigate the mitochondrialresponses to glycolytic and calcium input. WWe use the model to explain experimental observations of the opposite effects of raising cytosolic Ca(2+)in low and high glucose, and to predict the effects of a mutation in the mitochondrial enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) in pancreatic beta-cells.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA simplified model for mitochondrial ATP production, Richard Bertram, Morten Gram Pedersenb, Dan S.

        "abstract":"Pancreatic beta-cells exhibit bursting oscillations with a wide range of periods. Whereas periods in isolated cells are generally either a few seconds or a few minutes, in intact islets of Langerhans they are intermediate (10-60 s). We develop a mathematical model for beta-cell electrical activity capable of generating this wide range of bursting oscillations. Unlike previous models, bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow processes, one with a relatively small time constant (1-5 s) and the other with a much larger time constant (1-2 min). Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time constant, hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by this, we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits islet-like, medium period oscillations from isolated cells. Finally, we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium bursting, suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or slow, with few or none that are intrinsically medium.",

Wherever possible, we used Markov models to represent the molecular structure and function of ion channels. The model includes detailed intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, with simulations of localized events such as sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release into a small intracellular volume bounded by the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Transporter-mediated Ca2+ fluxes from the bulk cytosol are closely matched to the experimentally reported values and predict stimulation rate-dependent changes in Ca2+ transients. Our model reproduces the properties of cardiac myocytes from two different regions of the heart: the apex and the septum. The septum has a relatively prolonged AP, which reflects a relatively small contribution from the rapid transient outward K+ current in the septum. The attribution of putative molecular bases for several of the component currents enables our mouse model to be used to simulate the behavior of genetically modified transgenic mice.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Computer model of action potential of mouse ventricular myocytes, Vladimir E.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential risks and benefits of interrupted therapy using standard population dynamical models of HIV replication kinetics. METHODS: Standard population dynamical models were used to study the effect of structured therapy interruptions on the immune effector cells, the latent cell compartment and the emergence of drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The models suggest that structured therapy interruption only leads to transient or sustained virus control if the immune effector cells increase during therapy. This increase must more than counterbalance the increase in susceptible target cells induced by therapy. The risk of inducing drug resistance by therapy interruptions or the risk of repopulating the pool of latent cells during drug-free periods may be small if the virus population remains at levels considerably below baseline. However, if the virus load increases during drug-free periods to levels similar to or higher than baseline before therapy, both these risks increase dramatically.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRisks and benefits of structured antiretroviral drug therapy interruptions in HIV-1 infection, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Michal Rembiszewski, Gabriel M.

We term these modules GTPase-cycle modules. The local concentrations of these proteins are spatially regulated between plasma membrane microdomains and between the plasma membrane and cytosol, but no data or models are available that quantitatively explain the effect of such regulation on signaling. We present a computational model of the GTPase-cycle module that predicts that the interplay of local G protein, R, and GAP concentrations gives rise to 16 distinct signaling regimes and numerous intermediate signaling phenomena. The regimes suggest alternative modes of the GTPase-cycle module that occur based on defined local concentrations of the component proteins. In one mode, signaling occurs while G protein and receptor are unclustered and GAP eliminates signaling; in another, G protein and receptor are clustered and GAP can rapidly modulate signaling but does not eliminate it. Experimental data from multiple GTPase-cycle modules is interpreted in light of these predictions. The latter mode explains previously paradoxical data in which GAP does not alter maximal current amplitude of G protein-activated ion channels, but hastens signaling. The predictions indicate how variations in local concentrations of the component proteins create GTPase-cycle modules with distinctive phenotypes. They provide a quantitative framework for investigating how regulation of local concentrations of components of the GTPase-cycle module affects signaling.",

A two-dimensional linear differential equation model of the hormone is formulated and is used to analyze plasma melatonin levels in 18 normal healthy male subjects during a constant routine. Recently developed Bayesian statistical procedures are used to incorporate correctly the magnitude of the immunoassay error into the analysis. The estimated parameters [median (range)] were clearance half-life of 23.67 (14.79-59.93) min, synthesis onset time of 2206 (1940-0029), synthesis offset time of 0621 (0246-0817), and maximum N-acetyltransferase activity of 7.17(2.34-17.93) pmol x l(-1) x min(-1). All were in good agreement with values from previous reports. The difference between synthesis offset time and the phase of the core temperature minimum was 1 h 15 min (-4 h 38 min-2 h 43 min). The correlation between synthesis onset and the dim light melatonin onset was 0.93. Our model provides a more physiologically plausible estimate of the melatonin synthesis onset time than that given by the dim light melatonin onset and the first reliable means of estimating the phase of synthesis offset. Our analysis shows that the circadian and pharmacokinetics parameters of melatonin can be reliably estimated from a single model.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA mathematical model of diurnal variations in human plasma melatonin levels, Emery N.

Despite not incorporating independent descriptions for each of the known currents measured through the cell membrane, the model is however capable to correctly reproduce both the healthy and pathological conditions of the epicardial tissue layer, the latter being characterized by the presence of a much deeper notch in the cardiac action potential as a result of a loss of functionality of sodium channels which leaves unopposed the transient outward potassium current.\n\n\n\n\nDespite being able of reproducing a great amount of available experimental data, one important limitation of the proposed minimal model is that it lacks of a complete description of intracellular calcium dynamics. Hence, the model cannot be used to study particular conditions of importance in the generation and development of arrhythmias, such as calcium overload, spontaneous calcium release or calcium-induced alternans. This limitation could be overcome however by coupling our simplified model of the cardiac transmembrane potential to a reduced model of the intracellular calcium cycling of the ventricular myocyte, such as the one suggested by Shiferaw et al.

This transduction process is governed by mechanical strain in the wall of the aorta. This neural signal is then relayed and further processed by the central and peripheral nervous systems into parallel sympathetic and parasympathetic tone signals. Sympathetic and parasympathetic tones drive release of norepinephrine and acetylcholine, respectively, into the neuromuscular junction of the sinoatrial node of the heart, thereby modulating the pacemaker activity at the sinoatrial node.

Two minimal models of these neurons are proposed. In model 1, bursting arises via fast activation and slow inactivation of a persistent Na+ current INaP-h. In model 2, bursting arises via a fast-activating persistent Na+ current INaP and slow activation of a K+ current IKS. In both models, action potentials are generated via fast Na+ and K+ currents. The two models have few differences in parameters to facilitate a rigorous comparison of the two different burst-generating mechanisms. Both models are consistent with many of the dynamic features of electrophysiological recordings from pre-BotC oscillatory bursting neurons in vitro, including voltage-dependent activity modes (silence, bursting, and beating), a voltage-dependent burst frequency that can vary from 0.05 to >1 Hz, and a decaying spike frequency during bursting. These results are robust and persist across a wide range of parameter values for both models. However, the dynamics of model 1 are more consistent with experimental data in that the burst duration decreases as the baseline membrane potential is depolarized and the model has a relatively flat membrane potential trajectory during the interburst interval. We propose several experimental tests to demonstrate the validity of either model and to differentiate between the two mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModels of Respiratory Rhythm Generation in the Pre-Botzinger Complex.

During these mitotic cycles, there are barely detectable oscillations in the total level of B-type cyclins. In this paper, we propose a dynamical model for the molecular events underlying these early nuclear division cycles in Drosophila. The model distinguishes nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the embryo and permits exploration of a variety of rules for protein transport between the compartments. Numerical simulations reproduce the main features of wild-type mitotic cycles: patterns of protein accumulation and degradation, lengthening of later cycles, and arrest in interphase 14. The model is consistent with mutations that introduce subtle changes in the number of mitotic cycles before interphase arrest. Bifurcation analysis of the differential equations reveals the dependence of mitotic oscillations on cycle number, and how this dependence is altered by mutations. The model can be used to predict the phenotypes of novel mutations and effective ranges of the unmeasured rate constants and transport coefficients in the proposed mechanism.",

        "abstract":"A Human Ventricular Cell Model for Investigation of Cardiac Arrhythmias under Hyperkalaemic Conditions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n### Abstract\n\n\nIn this study, several modifications were introduced to a recently proposed human ventricular action potential (AP) model so as to render it suitable for the study of ventricular arrhythmias. These modifications were driven by new sets of experimental data available from the literature and the analysis of several well-established cellular arrhythmic risk biomarkers, namely AP duration at 90 per cent repolarization (APD90), AP triangulation, calcium dynamics, restitution properties, APD90 adaptation to abrupt heart rate changes, and rate dependence of intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. The proposed methodology represents a novel framework for the development of cardiac cell models. Five stimulation protocols were applied to the original model and the ventricular AP model developed here to compute the described arrhythmic risk biomarkers. In addition, those models were tested in a one-dimensional fibre in which hyperkalaemia was simulated by increasing the extracellular potassium concentration, [K+]o. The effective refractory period (ERP), conduction velocity (CV) and the occurrence of APD alternans were investigated. Results show that modifications improved model behaviour as verified by: (i) AP triangulation well within experimental limits (the difference between APD at 50 and 90 per cent repolarization being 78.1 ms); (ii) APD90 rate adaptation dynamics characterized by fast and slow time constants within physiological ranges (10.1 and 105.9 ms); and (iii) maximum S1S2 restitution slope in accordance with experimental data (SS1S2=1.0). In simulated tissues under hyperkalaemic conditions, APD90 progressively shortened with the degree of hyperkalaemia, whereas ERP increased once a threshold in [K+]o was reached ([K+]o= 6 mM). CV decreased with [K+]o, and conduction was blocked for [K+]o>10.4 mM. APD90 alternans were observed for [K+]o>9.8 mM. Those results adequately reproduce experimental observations. This study demonstrated the value of basing the development of AP models on the computation of arrhythmic risk biomarkers, as opposed to joining together independently derived ion channel descriptions to produce a whole-cell AP model, with the new framework providing a better picture of the model performance under a variety of stimulation conditions. On top of replicating experimental data at single-cell level, the model developed here was able to predict the occurrence of APD90 alternans and areas of conduction block associated with high [K+]o in tissue, which is of relevance for the investigation of the arrhythmogenic substrate in ischaemic hearts.",

In this model the hypothalamic secretion of the hormone LHRH (luteinizing hormone releasing hormone) is controlled by a combination of local testosterone concentration and of the local concentration of the pituitary hormone LH (luteinizing hormone). Since LHRH stimulates the release of LH, and LH in turn stimulates the release of testosterone, the three hormones constitute a three-component \"feedback\" network. We show how this model is able to account for the pulsatility of the release of these three hormones. Furthermore, the model is consistent with results obtained from a wide range of experimental manipulations of the system. For example, it accounts for the changes observed in hormone release patterns after castration. In particular, it follows that no \"neural clock\", or \"neural pulse-generator\", is required to force the system into pulsatile behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA model for the control of testosterone secretion, Mark Cartwright and Masud Husain, 1986, \n *Journal of Theoretical Biology*\n 123, 239-250.

The units have ben checked and they are consistent. We are unsure whether or not the model recreates the published results as there are no simple figures of changing concentration against time. Also sodium and chloride are set to constant values in this model - we suspect we need to derive an ODE equation based on the reaction figure (fig 1) in the paper.\n\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to construct a numerical model of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC) that can predict kinetics of thiazide binding and substrate transport of TSC. We hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying these kinetic properties can be approximated by a state diagram in which the transporter has two binding sites, one for sodium and another for chloride and thiazide. On the basis of the state diagram, a system of linear equations that should be satisfied in the steady state was postulated. Numerical solution of these equations yielded model prediction of kinetics of thiazide binding and substrate transport. Rate constants, which determine transitional rates between states, were systematically adjusted to minimize a penalty function that was devised to quantitatively estimate the difference between model predictions and experimental results. With the resultant rate constants, the model could simulate the following experimental results: 1) dissociation constant of thiazide in the absence of sodium and chloride; 2) inhibitory effect of chloride on thiazide binding; 3) stimulatory effect of sodium on thiazide binding; 4) combined effects of sodium and chloride on thiazide binding; 5) dependence of sodium influx on extracellular sodium and chloride; and 6) inhibition of sodium influx by extracellular thiazide. We conclude that known kinetic properties of TSC can be predicted by a model which is based on a state diagram.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n  \n\nA kinetic model of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter, Hangil Chang and Toshiro Fujita, 1999, *American Journal of Physiology*, **276**, F952-F959.

In recent years, many elegant experiments on budding yeast have dissected the roles of cyclin molecules (Cln1\u20133 and Clb1\u20136) in coordinating the events of DNA synthesis, bud emergence, spindle formation, nuclear division, and cell separation. These experimental clues suggest a mechanism for the principal molecular interactions controlling cyclin synthesis and degradation. Using standard techniques of biochemical kinetics, we convert the mechanism into a set of differential equations, which describe the time courses of three major classes of cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Model in hand, we examine the molecular events controlling \u201cStart\u201d (the commitment step to a new round of chromosome replication, bud formation, and mitosis) and \u201cFinish\u201d (the transition from metaphase to anaphase, when sister chromatids are pulled apart and the bud separates from the mother cell) in wild-type cells and 50 mutants.

The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase regulation, converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other predictions, the model attributes a new role to Hsl1, a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 degradation: Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity.

Cdk1 activity peaks at mitosis, driven by periodic degradation of cyclins A and B. In contrast, Cdk2 activity oscillates twice per cell cycle, despite a constant level of its partner, cyclin E. Cyclin E degrades at a fixed time after fertilization, normally corresponding to the midblastula transition. Based on published data and new experiments, we constructed a mathematical model in which: (1) oscillations in Cdk2 activity depend upon changes in phosphorylation, (2) Cdk2 participates in a negative feedback loop with the inhibitory kinase Wee1; (3) cyclin E is cooperatively removed from the oscillatory system; and (4) removed cyclin E is degraded by a pathway activated by cyclin E\/Cdk2 itself. The model's predictions about embryos injected with Xic1, a stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin E\/Cdk2, were experimentally validated.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n A kinetic model of the cyclin E\/Cdk2 developmental timer in *Xenopus laevis* embryos, Andrea Ciliberto, Matthew J.

S and M phases are temporally separated by gaps, called the G1 and G2 phases respectively. However, in early development, when the main aim of embryo is to increase cell number by a series of rapid cell divisions, the cell cycle has a number of unique features: \n\n\n\n* interdivision time is short and nearly constant;\n* S and M phases alternate in time without intervening G1 or G2 phases;\n* cell division is nearly synchronous and most cells take part;\n* and the nucleocytoplasmic ration (NCR) of cells increases dramatically.\n\n\n\nIt is believed that the NCR controls the cell cycle characteristics during the early stages of devlopment. This idea has been incorporated into the following mathematical model of early devlopmental cell cycle control. \n\n\n\n\nThe molecular components involved in mitotic control have been studied extensively in the last decade, and a control system, common to all eukaryotes, has been elucidated. This has been the subject of several mathematical models, including models which use budding yeast as the experimental organism: \n\n\n\n* [Modelling the control of DNA replication in fission yeast, Novak and Tyson, 1997](http:\/\/www.cellml.org\/models\/novak_tyson_1997_version01)\n* [Mathematical Model of the Fission Yeast Cell Cycle, Novak *et al.*, 1998](http:\/\/www.cellml.org\/models\/novak_csikasz-nagy_gyorffy_chen_tyson_1998_version01)\n* [Chen *et al.*, Modelling the Budding Yeast Cell Cycle, 2000](http:\/\/www.cellml.org\/models\/chen_csikasz-nagy_gyorffy_val_novak_tyson_2000_version02)\n* [Ciliberto *et al.* Modelling the Morphogenesis Checkpoint in the Budding Yeast Cell Cycle, 2003](http:\/\/www.cellml.org\/models\/ciliberto_novak_tyson_2003_version01)\n\n\n\nand those which use the Xenopus oocyte and embryo: [Ciliberto *et al.* A Kinetic Model of the Cyclin E\/Cdk2 Developmental Timer in *Xenopus laevis* embryos, 2003](http:\/\/www.cellml.org\/models\/ciliberto_petrus_tyson_sible_2003_version01).\n\n\n\n\nIn the Ciliberto and Tyson 2000 publication described here, the authors develop a mathematical model based on the molecular interactions underlying early embryonic cell cycle control (see \n the figure\n below).

LQT2 may give rise to severe arrhythmogenic phenotypes leading to sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE: We attempt to elucidate the mechanisms by which heterogeneous LQT2 genotypes can lead to prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and consequently the QT interval on the ECG. METHODS: We develop Markovian models of wild-type (WT) and mutant I(Kr) channels and incorporate these models into a comprehensive model of the cardiac ventricular cell. RESULTS: Using this virtual transgenic cell model, we describe the effects of HERG mutations on the cardiac ventricular action potential (AP) and provide insight into the mechanism by which each defect results in a net loss of repolarizing current and prolongation of APD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates which mutations can prolong APD sufficiently to generate early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which may trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. The severity of the phenotype is shown to depend on the specific kinetic changes and how they affect I(Kr) during the time course of the action potential.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Complex physiological interactions determine the functional consequences of gene abnormalities and make mechanistic interpretation of phenotypes extremely difficult. A recent example is a single mutation in the C terminus of the cardiac Na(+) channel, 1795insD. The mutation causes two distinct clinical syndromes, long QT (LQT) and Brugada, leading to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Coexistence of these syndromes is seemingly paradoxical; LQT is associated with enhanced Na(+) channel function, and Brugada with reduced function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a computational approach, we demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation exerts variable effects depending on the myocardial substrate. We develop Markov models of the wild-type and 1795insD cardiac Na(+) channels. By incorporating the models into a virtual transgenic cell, we elucidate the mechanism by which 1795insD differentially disrupts cellular electrical behavior in epicardial and midmyocardial cell types. We provide a cellular mechanistic basis for the ECG abnormalities observed in patients carrying the 1795insD gene mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the 1795insD mutation can cause both LQT and Brugada syndromes through interaction with the heterogeneous myocardium in a rate-dependent manner. The results highlight the complexity and multiplicity of genotype-phenotype relationships, and the usefulness of computational approaches in establishing a mechanistic link between genetic defects and functional abnormalities.",

The present study aimed to construct a more comprehensive model of the electrical activity of a human SAN pacemaker cell using recently obtained electrophysiological data from human SAN pacemaker cells. We based our model on the recent Severi-DiFrancesco model of a rabbit SAN pacemaker cell. The action\npotential and calcium transient of the resulting model are close to the experimentally recorded values: the model has a much smaller 'funny current' (*I*f) than do rabbit cells, although its\nmodulatory role is highly similar. Changes in pacing rate upon the implementation of mutations\nassociated with sinus node dysfunction agree with the clinical observations. This agreement holds\nfor both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in the *HCN4*, *SCN5A* and *KCNQ1*\ngenes, underlying ion channelopathies in *I*f, fast sodium current and slow delayed rectifier\npotassium current, respectively.We conclude that our human SAN cellmodel can be a useful tool\nin the design of experiments and the development of drugs that aim to modulate heart rate.\n\n\n\n![human SAN cell schematic diagram](hSAN schematic model.png \"Human SAN cell schematic diagram\")",

Moreover, the phenotypical differences between the hiPSC-CM and adult myocyte action potentials (APs) call for understanding of how hiPSC-CMs are maturing towards adult myocytes. Using recently published experimental data, we developed two computational models of the hiPSC-CM action potential (AP), distinguishing between the ventricular-like and atrial-like phenotypes, emerging during the differentiation process of hiPSC-CMs. Also, we used the computational approach to quantitatively assess the role of ionic mechanisms which are likely responsible for the not completely mature phenotype of hiPSC-CMs. Our models reproduce the typical hiPSC-CM ventricular-like and atrial-like spontaneous APs and the response to prototypical current blockers, namely tetrodotoxine, nifedipine, E4041 and 3R4S-Chromanol 293B. Moreover, simulations using our ventricular-like model suggest that the interplay of immature INa, If and IK1 currents has a fundamental role in the hiPSC-CM spontaneous beating whereas a negative shift in ICaL activation causes the observed long lasting AP. In conclusion, this work provides two novel tools useful in investigating the electrophysiological features of hiPSC-CMs, whose importance is growing fast as in-vitro models for pharmacological studies.\n\n\n### Pubmed Link: <http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23722932>\n\n\n**COR specifics**\n-----------------\n\n\nTwo different model versions are avaible, respectively marked as Atrial and Ventricular in the Files section.\n\n\nThe Ventricular version includes a compartment for the simulation of a stimulus current injection and one for the simulation of the effect of current blockers.\n\n\nTo simulate the presence of stimulus current:\n\n\n* the 'stim\\_flag' constant in the 'stim\\_mode' compartment needs to be set to 1.\n* 'i\\_stim\\_Amplitude' sets the stimulus intensity expressed in Ampere\n* 'i\\_stim\\_start' sets the current injection starting time in Seconds\n* 'i\\_stim\\_end' sets the current injection stop time in Seconds\n* 'i\\_stim\\_frequency' sets the number of stimulation pulses per minute (es. 60 means 1Hz stimulation)\n* 'i\\_stim\\_PulseDuration' sets the pulse duration in Seconds\n\n\nTo simulate the effects of current blockers, one of the corresponding flags in the 'current\\_blockers' compatment need to be set to 1.

This model was produced using the parameter values on page 360. This file is known to run on COR 0.9 and Open Cell.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nNumerous top-down kinetic models have been constructed to describe the cell cycle. These models have typically been constructed, validated and analyzed using model species (molecular intermediates and proteins) and phenotypic observations, and therefore do not focus on the individual model processes (reaction steps). We have developed a method to: (a) quantify the importance of each of the reaction steps in a kinetic model for the positioning of a switch point [i.e. the restriction point (RP)]; (b) relate this control of reaction steps to their effects on molecular species, using sensitivity and co-control analysis; and thereby (c) go beyond a correlation towards a causal relationship between molecular species and effects. The method is generic and can be applied to responses of any type, but is most useful for the analysis of dynamic and emergent responses such as switch points in the cell cycle. The strength of the analysis is illustrated for an existing mammalian cell cycle model focusing on the RP [Novak B, Tyson J (2004) J Theor Biol230, 563-579]. The reactions in the model with the highest RP control were those involved in: (a) the interplay between retinoblastoma protein and E2F transcription factor; (b) those synthesizing the delayed response genes and cyclin D\/Cdk4 in response to growth signals; (c) the E2F-dependent cyclin E\/Cdk2 synthesis reaction; as well as (d) p27 formation reactions. Nine of the 23 intermediates were shown to have a good correlation between their concentration control and RP control. Sensitivity and co-control analysis indicated that the strongest control of the RP is mediated via the cyclin E\/Cdk2:p27 complex concentration. Any perturbation of the RP could be related to a change in the concentration of this complex; apparent effects of other molecular species were indirect and always worked through cyclin E\/Cdk2:p27, indicating a causal relationship between this complex and the positioning of the RP.\n\n\nRestriction point control of the mammalian cell cycle via the cyclin E\/Cdk2:p27 complex, Conradie R, Bruggeman F J, Ciliberto A, Csikasz-Nagy A, Novak B, Westerhoff H V, Snoep J L *FEB Journal*, 277, 357-367[PubMed ID: 20015233](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20015233)",

While the ICC provide a constant source of electrical activity, and can be regarded as the *pacemaker* of the gastrointestinal (GI) system, the ENS adds an extra level of control. In combination the ICC and ENS act as a stimulus, causing the SM cells to contract and generate slow wave activity in the GI. These regular, autonomous depolarisations are then propagated via gap junctions to the neighbouring SM cells in the gut wall. \n\n\n\n\nSM cells themselves are unable to generate or propagate slow waves autonomously. Instead they response to the electrical stimuli generated by neighbouring ICC as voltage-dependent ion channels embedded within their cell surface membrane become activated and other extracellular ligands and intracellular second messengers (such as calcium ions) also modify the response of the SM cells. As such, the inherent complexity of such a system quickly becomes apparent, and the role of mathematical models in dissecting the system and characterising the different functions of each individual component becomes clear. However, while computational models of cardiac electrophysiology have advanced considerably over the past few years, to date, models of gastric electrophysiology have been limited by the absence of single cell models which form the foundation for the more complex, large scale, integrated models. \n\n\n\n\nIn the present study Alberto Corrias and Martin Buist address this issue by presenting an electrophysiolgical model of a single gastric SM cell. The model parameters are based on real, experimentally recorded, physiological data, and the model has also been kept relatively simple to make it computationally efficient, and therefore suitable for embedding within multicellular simulations.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA quantitative model of gastric smooth muscle cellular activation, Alberto Corrias and Martin L.

The model describes the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial Ca(2+) handling. The kinetic component of the model includes effectors of the TCA cycle enzymes regulating production of NADH and FADH(2), which in turn are used by the electron transport chain to establish a proton motive force (\u0394\u03bc(H)), driving the F(1)F(0)-ATPase. In addition, mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+), determined by Ca(2+) uniporter and Na(+)\/Ca(2+) exchanger activities, regulates activity of the TCA cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The model is described by twelve ordinary differential equations for the time rate of change of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8(m)), and matrix concentrations of Ca(2+), NADH, ADP, and TCA cycle intermediates. The model is used to predict the response of mitochondria to changes in substrate delivery, metabolic inhibition, the rate of adenine nucleotide exchange, and Ca(2+). The model is able to reproduce, qualitatively and semiquantitatively, experimental data concerning mitochondrial bioenergetics, Ca(2+) dynamics, and respiratory control. Significant increases in oxygen consumption (V(O(2))), proton efflux, NADH, and ATP synthesis, in response to an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+), are obtained when the Ca(2+)-sensitive dehydrogenases are the main rate-controlling steps of respiratory flux. These responses diminished when control is shifted downstream (e.g., the respiratory chain or adenine nucleotide translocator). The time-dependent behavior of the model, under conditions simulating an increase in workload, closely reproduces experimentally observed mitochondrial NADH dynamics in heart trabeculae subjected to changes in pacing frequency. The steady-state and time-dependent behavior of the model support the hypothesis that mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) plays an important role in matching energy supply with demand in cardiac myocytes.",

A major unresolved issue is the identification of receptor properties that critically determine processing of ligand-encoded information. We show by mathematical modeling of quantitative data and experimental validation that rapid ligand depletion and replenishment of the cell surface receptor are characteristic features of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). The amount of Epo-EpoR complexes and EpoR activation integrated over time corresponds linearly to ligand input; this process is carried out over a broad range of ligand concentrations. This relation depends solely on EpoR turnover independent of ligand binding, which suggests an essential role of large intracellular receptor pools.

To gain a clearer understanding of and to quantify the extent to which parameters of the pathway affect glycerol flux in S. cerevisiae, a kinetic model of the glycerol synthesis pathway has been constructed. Kinetic parameters were collected from published values. Maximal enzyme activities and intracellular effector concentrations were determined experimentally. The model was validated by comparing experimental results on the rate of glycerol production to the rate calculated by the model. Values calculated by the model agreed well with those measured in independent experiments. The model also mimics the changes in the rate of glycerol synthesis at different phases of growth. Metabolic control analysis values calculated by the model indicate that the NAD(+)-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction has a flux control coefficient (Cv1J) of approximately 0.85 and exercises the majority of the control of flux through the pathway. Response coefficients of parameter metabolites indicate that flux through the pathway is most responsive to dihydroxyacetone phosphate concentration (RDHAPJ = 0.48 to 0.69), followed by ATP concentration (RATPJ = \u22120.21 to \u22120.50). Interestingly, the pathway responds weakly to NADH concentration (RNADHJ = 0.03 to 0.08). The model indicates that the best strategy to increase flux through the pathway is not to increase enzyme activity, substrate concentration, or coenzyme concentration alone but to increase all of these parameters in conjunction with each other.",

The idiosyncrasies of cell cycle regulation in particular organisms can be attributed, we claim, to specific settings of rate constants in the dynamic network of chemical reactions. The values of these rate constants are determined ultimately by the genetic makeup of an organism. To support these claims, we convert the reaction mechanism into a set of governing kinetic equations and provide parameter values (specific to budding yeast, fission yeast, frog eggs, and mammalian cells) that account for many curious features of cell cycle regulation in these organisms. Using one-parameter bifurcation diagrams, we show how overall cell growth drives progression through the cell cycle, how cell-size homeostasis can be achieved by two different strategies, and how mutations remodel bifurcation diagrams and create unusual cell-division phenotypes.

Isolated beta -cells, however, exhibit atypical bursting or continuous spike activity. We study bursting as an emergent property of the population, focussing on interactions among the subclass of spiking cells. These are modelled by equipping the fast subsystem with a saddle-node-loop bifurcation, which makes it monostable. Such cells can only spike tonically or remain silent when isolated, but can be induced to burst with weak diffusive coupling. With stronger coupling, the cells revert to tonic spiking. We demonstrate that the addition of noise dramatically increases, via a phenomenon like stochastic resonance, the coupling range over which bursting is seen.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nChannel Sharing in Pancreatic Beta-Cells Revisited: Enhancement of Emergent Bursting by Noise, Gerda De Vries and Arthur Sherman, 2000,\n *The Journal Of Theoretical Biology*\n , 207, 513-530.

        "abstract":"Computational models of cardiac myocytes are important tools for understanding ionic mechanisms of arrhythmia. This work presents a new model of the canine epicardial myocyte that reproduces a wide range of experimentally observed rate-dependent behaviors in cardiac cell and tissue, including action potential (AP) duration (APD) adaptation, restitution, and accommodation. Model behavior depends on updated formulations for the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive transient outward current (I(to1)), the slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)), the L-type Ca(2+) channel current (I(Ca,L)), and the Na(+)-K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) fit to data from canine ventricular myocytes. We found that I(to1) plays a limited role in potentiating peak I(Ca,L) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release for propagated APs but modulates the time course of APD restitution. I(Ks) plays an important role in APD shortening at short diastolic intervals, despite a limited role in AP repolarization at longer cycle lengths. In addition, we found that I(Ca,L) plays a critical role in APD accommodation and rate dependence of APD restitution. Ca(2+) entry via I(Ca,L) at fast rate drives increased Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger Ca(2+) extrusion and Na(+) entry, which in turn increases Na(+) extrusion via outward I(NaK). APD accommodation results from this increased outward I(NaK). Our simulation results provide valuable insight into the mechanistic basis of rate-dependent phenomena important for determining the heart's response to rapid and irregular pacing rates (e.g., arrhythmia). Accurate simulation of rate-dependent phenomena and increased understanding of their mechanistic basis will lead to more realistic multicellular simulations of arrhythmia and identification of molecular therapeutic targets.",

Physiol. 266 (Cell Physiol. 35): C832-C852, 1994] of the single rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cell so that it can simulate cellular responses to bath applications of ACh and isoprenaline as well as the effects of neuronally released ACh. The model employs three different types of muscarinic receptors to explain the variety of responses observed in mammalian cardiac pacemaking cells subjected to vagal stimulation. The response of greatest interest is the ACh-sensitive change in cycle length that is not accompanied by a change in action potential duration or repolarization or hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic potential. In this case, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is not involved. Membrane hyperpolarization occurs in response to much higher levels of vagal stimulation, and this response is also mimicked by the model. Here, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is involved. The well-known phase-resetting response of the SAN cell to single and periodically applied vagal bursts of impulses is also simulated in the presence and absence of the beta-agonist isoprenaline. Finally, the responses of the SAN cell to longer continuous trains of periodic vagal stimulation are simulated, and this can result in the complete cessation of pacemaking. Therefore, this model is 1) applicable over the full range of intensity and pattern of vagal input and 2) can offer biophysically based explanations for many of the phenomena associated with the autonomic control of cardiac pacemaking.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nParasympathetic modulation of sinoatrial node pacemaker activity in rabbit heart: a unifying model, Semahat S.

To investigate the causal relation of ACTH to the secretion of cortisol, a mechanistic mathematical model based on current hypotheses of adrenocortical function was constructed and tested. It is widely believed that ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion through adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), which provides substrate cholesterol by activating cholesterol ester hydrolase and facilitating transport of cholesterol to the side-chain cleavage enzyme. In addition, cholesterol modulates its own synthesis by inhibiting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase in the adrenocortical cell. These and other steps in the biosynthetic reaction sequence were described using differential equations subject to the additional constraints imposed by available measurements of intracellular quantities. The resulting model is consistent with many of the known characteristics of the canine adrenal response to ACTH. In this model, steady-state nonlinearities arise from cooperative binding of cAMP to its receptor protein and saturation of mitochondrial pregnenolone transport. The transient response is dominated by a depletable pool of intracellular free cholesterol. Other inferences based on the model are presented, and a quantifiable cellular basis for increased adrenal sensitivity to ACTH is proposed.\n\n\n\n\nA mechanistic model of ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion, D.P.

These \nrhythms are generated by a genetic regulatory network involving a negative feedback \nloop on transcription. Mathematical models based on the negative autoregulation of \ngene expression by the protein product of a clock gene account for the occurrence of self- \nsustained circadian oscillations. These models differ by their degree of complexity and, \nhence, by the number of variables considered. Some of these models can be considered as \nminimal because they contain a reduced number of biochemical processes and variables \ncapable of producing sustained oscillations. In three of these minimal models, the period \nof the oscillations significantly changes with the rate of degradation of the clock protein. \nHowever, depending on the model considered, the period increases, decreases or passes \nthrough a maximum as a function of the protein degradation rate. We clarify the \nbases for these markedly different results by bringing to light the roles of (i) protein \nphosphorylation, which is required for protein degradation, and (ii) the velocity and \ndegree of saturation of mRNA and protein degradation. Changes in the parameter values \nof the more complex of the minimal models can produce the period profiles observed in \nthe other two models.

Several specific areas of improvement in representation of rumen processes were reconsidered during model development. These included microbial substrate preference, differential outflow and chemical composition of rumen microbes, recycling of microbial matter within the rumen, uncoupling of fermentation with respect to nitrogen availability, reduced microbial activity at reduced rumen pH and pH-dependent absorption of volatile fatty acids and ammonia. The model was used to examine the effects of the diet on the profile of nutrients available for absorption and was shown to respond appropriately to different intake and nitrogen levels. The validity of the improvements and the predictions of nutrient supply on a variety of dietary inputs are tested in a companion paper.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nSimulation of nutrient digestion, absorption and outflow in the rumen: model description, Dijkstra J, Neal HD, Beever DE, and France J, 1992, *The Journal of Nutrition*, 122, 2239-2256.

The new model provides a review and update of existing formulations of sinoatrial node membrane currents, derived from a wide range of electrophysiological data available in the literature. Simulations of spontaneous activity suggest that the dominant mechanism underlying pacemaker depolarisation is the inward background Na+ current, ib,Na. In contrast to previous models, the decay of the delayed rectifying K+ current, iK, was insignificant during this phase. Despite the presence of a pseudo-outward background current throughout the pacemaker range of potentials (Na-K pump+leak currents), the hyperpolarisation-activated current i(f) was not essential to pacemaker activity. A closer inspection of the current-voltage characteristics of the model revealed that the \"instantaneous\" time-independent current was inward for holding potentials in the pacemaker range, which rapidly became outward within 2 ms due to the inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ current, iCa,L. This suggests that reports in the literature in which the net background current is outward throughout the pacemaker range of potentials may be exaggerated. The magnitudes of the action potential overshoot and the maximum diastolic potential were determined largely by the reversal potentials of iCa,L and iK respectively. The action potential was sustained by the incomplete deactivation of iCa,L and the Na-Ca exchanger, iNaCa. Despite the incorporation of \"square-root\" activation by [K]o of all K+ currents, the model was unable to correctly simulate the response to elevated [K]o.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIon Currents Underlying Sinoatrial Node Pacemaker Activity: A New Single Cell Mathematical Model, Socrates Dokos, Branko Celler, and Nigel Lovell, 1996, \n *Theoretical Journal of Biology*\n , 181, 245-272.

The model takes into account the existence of two pools of intracellular Ca2+, namely, one sensitive to inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (InsP3) whose synthesis is elicited by the stimulus, and one insensitive to InsP3. The discharge of the latter pool into the cytosol is activated by cytosolic Ca2+. Oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ arise in this model either spontaneously or in an appropriate range of external stimulation; these oscillations do not require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The following properties of the model are reviewed and compared with experimental observations: (a) Control of the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations by the external stimulus or extracellular Ca2+; (b) correlation of latency with period of Ca2+ oscillations obtained at different levels of stimulation; (c) effect of a transient increase in InsP3; (d) phase shift and transient suppression of Ca2+ oscillations by Ca2+ pulses, and (e) propagation of Ca2+ waves. It is shown that on all these counts the model provides a simple, unified explanation for a number of experimental observations in a variety of cell types. The model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release can be extended to incorporate variations in the level of InsP3 as well as desensitization of the InsP3 receptor; besides accounting for the phenomena described by the minimal model, the extended model might also account for the occurrence of complex Ca2+ oscillations.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n Signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations: properties of a model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release, Dupont G, Berridge M.J, Goldbeter A, 1991, *Cell Calcium*\n 12, 73-85.

Surges of PRL secretion occur in response to relief from hypothalamic dopaminergic (DA) inhibition and stimulation by hypothalamic releasing neurohormones. In this study we characterize the role of oxytocin (OT) in this system and the involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in controlling OT and PRL secretion of CS rats. The effect of OT on PRL secretion was demonstrated in cultured lactotrophs showing simultaneous enhanced secretion rate and increased intracellular Ca(2+). Neurosecretory OT cells of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus which express VIP receptors were identified by using immunocytochemical techniques in combination with the retrogradely transported neuronal tracer Fluoro-Gold (i.v. injected). OT measurements of serial blood samples obtained from ovariectomized (OVX) CS rats displayed a prominent secretory peak at the time of the afternoon PRL peak. The injection of VIP antisense oligonucleotides into the SCN abolished the afternoon increase of OT and PRL in CS-OVX animals. These findings suggest that there is an involvement of VIP from the SCN contributing in the regulation of OT and PRL secretion in CS rats. We propose that in CS rats the regulatory mechanism(s) for PRL secretion comprise coordinated action of neuroendocrine DA and OT cells, both governed by the daily rhythm of VIPergic output from the SCN. This hypothesis is illustrated with a mathematical model.",

Testosterone secretion from the testes is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and the production of LH is, in turn, stimulated by the hypothalamic hormone luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) (as summarised in the figure below). Interestingly, the observed fluctuations in the blood levels of testosterone can be traced back to the pulsatile release of LHRH. Several mathematical models have been proposed to describe the pulsatile release of these three hormones. Some of these models depend on an introduced delay in one of the variables in order to create oscillations in an otherwise stable model. Examples of such delayed mathematical models include those published by Cartwright and Husain (1980) which describes the control of testosterone secretion, and also the model published by Lenbury and Pornsawad (2005) to characterise feedback control in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in humans. Both of these models have been translated into CellML and can be found in the model repository. However, while delayed models can be biologically realistic (for example there is often a delay between the secretion of a hormone and the binding of that hormone to its receptor and the subsequent response), introducing a delay to a mathematical model often comes at the expense of increased model complexity. (In particular, it should be noted that in its current form, CellML is unable to express time delays). \n\n\n\n\nIn the paper described here, Enciso and Sontag critique published mathematical models which describe testosterone dynamics. In particular they highlight how models which use time delays to create hormone oscillations can exhibit stability.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nOn the stability of a model of testosterone dynamics, German Enciso and Eduardo D.

In giant excised inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing rabbit SGLT1, application of \u03b1-methyl-d-glucopyranoside (\u03b1MDG) to the cytoplasmic solution induced an outward current from cytosolic to external membrane surface. The outward current was Na(+) - and sugar-dependent, and was blocked by phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of SGLT1. The current-voltage relationship saturated at positive membrane voltages (30\u201350 mV), and approached zero at \u2212 150 mV. The half-maximal concentration for \u03b1MDG-evoked outward current ([Formula: see text]) was 35 mM (at 0 mV). In comparison, [Formula: see text] for forward sugar transport was 0.15 mM (at 0 mV). [Formula: see text] was similar for forward and reverse transport (\u224835 mM at 0 mV). Specificity of SGLT1 for reverse transport was: \u03b1MDG (1.0) > d-galactose (0.84) > 3-O-methyl-glucose (0.55) > d-glucose (0.38), whereas for forward transport, specificity was: \u03b1MDG \u2248 d-glucose \u2248 d-galactose > 3-O-methyl-glucose. Thus there is an asymmetry in sugar kinetics and specificity between forward and reverse modes. Computer simulations showed that a 6-state kinetic model for SGLT1 can account for Na(+)\/sugar cotransport and its voltage dependence in both the forward and reverse modes at saturating sodium concentrations. Our data indicate that under physiological conditions, the transporter is poised to accumulate sugar efficiently in the enterocyte.",

This work contributes to the understanding of cardiovascular system modifications induced by changes in the atmospheric environment.\n\n\n\n\nHypertrophied myocytes show an important increase in action potential duration, particularly at the delayed phase of the repolarisation. Although it is well known that Ito and ICaL are decreased in hypertrophied rats, we hypothesized that the Na+\/Ca2+ exchange current could be implied in the prolongation of action potential duration in hypertrophied cells. The electrophysiological study of myocytes was achieved using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. This configuration was obtained in two ways: the conventional broken patch technique, which allows to control the internal medium composition and to buffer the intracellular calcium, and the perforated patch technique which allows to respect the internal composition of each cell.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to test for the implication of Na+\/Ca2+ exchange current, we compared the action potentials obtained in control and in hypertrophied cells, in ionic conditions where the Na+\/Ca2+ exchanger was either present or blocked.\n\n\n\n\nThe Na+\/Ca2+ exchanger current measured in voltage clamp conditions was also compared in control and hypertrophied cells.\n\n\n\n\nOur results clearly show and implication of Na+\/Ca2+ exchanger current in the prolongation of action potentials recorded in hypertrophied cells. Concerning the underlying mechanisms, the voltage clamp experiments show that the increased exchanger current is induced by a modification of the driving force for the exchanger rather than by a modification of \u201cconductance\u201d or density of Na+\/Ca2+ exchanger proteins. The modification of the driving force could be induced by a change in the regulation of calcium concentration by the sarcoplasmic reticulum or by the action potential duration itself.\n\n\n\n\nThe experimental data acquired in this study, were used in a mathematical simulation of the action potential (Oxsoft Heart model).

        "abstract":"Sodium overload of cardiac cells can accompany various pathologies and induce fatal cardiac arrhythmias. We investigate effects of elevated intracellular sodium on the cardiac action potential (AP) and on intracellular calcium using the Luo-Rudy model of a mammalian ventricular myocyte. The results are: 1) During rapid pacing, AP duration (APD) shortens in two phases, a rapid phase without Na(+) accumulation and a slower phase that depends on [Na(+)](i). 2) The rapid APD shortening is due to incomplete deactivation (accumulation) of I(Ks). 3) The slow phase is due to increased repolarizing currents I(NaK) and reverse-mode I(NaCa), secondary to elevated [Na(+)](i). 4) Na(+)-overload slows the rate of AP depolarization, allowing time for greater I(Ca(L)) activation; it also enhances reverse-mode I(NaCa). The resulting increased Ca(2+) influx triggers a greater [Ca(2+)](i) transient. 5) Reverse-mode I(NaCa) alone can trigger Ca(2+) release in a voltage and [Na(+)](i)-dependent manner. 6) During I(NaK) block, Na(+) and Ca(2+) accumulate and APD shortens due to enhanced reverse-mode I(NaCa); contribution of I(K(Na)) to APD shortening is negligible.

Dynamics of cytokine\/receptor endocytic trafficking can significantly impact cell responses through effects of receptor down-regulation and ligand depletion, and in turn are governed by ligand\/receptor binding properties. We describe here a computational model for trafficking dynamics of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) system, which is able to predict T cell proliferation responses to IL-2. This model comprises kinetic equations describing binding, internalization, and postendocytic sorting of IL-2 and IL-2R, including an experimentally derived dependence of cell proliferation rate on these properties. Computational results from this model predict that IL-2 depletion can be reduced by decreasing its binding affinity for the IL-2R betagamma subunit relative to the alpha subunit at endosomal pH, as a result of enhanced ligand sorting to recycling vis-a-vis degradation, and that an IL-2 analogue with such altered binding properties should exhibit increased potency for stimulating the T cell proliferation response. These results are in agreement with our recent experimental findings for the IL-2 analogue termed 2D1 [Fallon, E. M. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 6790-6797]. Thus, this type of model may enable prediction of beneficial cytokine\/receptor binding properties to aid development of molecular design criteria for improvements in applications such as in vivo cytokine therapies and in vitro hematopoietic cell bioreactors.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nComputational Model for Effects of Ligand\/Receptor Binding Properties on Interleukin-2 Trafficking Dynamics and T Cell Proliferation Response, Eric M.

This particular version of the CellML model has had a stimulus protocol added to allow it to simulate trains of action potentials.

Simulations of this CellML model can be run using CMISS.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Wave propagation in ventricular muscle is rendered highly anisotropic by the intramural rotation of the fiber. This rotational anisotropy is especially important because it can produce a twist of electrical vortices, which measures the rate of rotation (in degree\/mm) of activation wavefronts in successive planes perpendicular to a line of phase singularity, or filament. This twist can then significantly alter the dynamics of the filament. This paper explores this dynamics via numerical simulation. After a review of the literature, we present modeling tools that include: (i) a simplified ionic model with three membrane currents that approximates well the restitution properties and spiral wave behavior of more complex ionic models of cardiac action potential (Beeler-Reuter and others), and (ii) a semi-implicit algorithm for the fast solution of monodomain cable equations with rotational anisotropy. We then discuss selected results of a simulation study of vortex dynamics in a parallelepipedal slab of ventricular muscle of varying wall thickness (S) and fiber rotation rate (theta(z)). The main finding is that rotational anisotropy generates a sufficiently large twist to destabilize a single transmural filament and cause a transition to a wave turbulent state characterized by a high density of chaotically moving filaments. This instability is manifested by the propagation of localized disturbances along the filament and has no previously known analog in isotropic excitable media. These disturbances correspond to highly twisted and distorted regions of filament, or \"twistons,\" that create vortex rings when colliding with the natural boundaries of the ventricle. Moreover, when sufficiently twisted, these rings expand and create additional filaments by further colliding with boundaries. This instability mechanism is distinct from the commonly invoked patchy failure or wave breakup that is not observed here during the initial instability. For modified Beeler-Reuter-like kinetics with stable reentry in two dimensions, decay into turbulence occurs in the left ventricle in about one second above a critical wall thickness in the range of 4-6 mm that matches experiment. However this decay is suppressed by uniformly decreasing excitability. Specific experiments to test these results, and a method to characterize the filament density during fibrillation are discussed. Results are contrasted with other mechanisms of fibrillation and future prospects are summarized.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Vortex dynamics in three-dimensional continuous myocardium with fiber rotation: Filament instability and fibrillation, Flavio Fenton and Alain Karma, 1998, *Chaos*, 8, 20-47.

Recent work has shown that one of the K+ currents (HERG) which contributes to repolarization in mammalian ventricle is a locus at which a number of point mutations can have significant functional consequences. In addition, the remarkable sensitivity of this K+ channel isoform to inhibition by a variety of pharmacological agents and clinical drugs has resulted in HERG being a major focus for Safety Pharmacology requirements. For these reasons we and others have attempted to define the functional role for HERG-mediated K+ currents in repolarization of the action potential in the human ventricle. Here, we describe and evaluate changes in the formulations for two K+ currents, IK1 and HERG (or IK,r), within the framework of ten Tusscher model of the human ventricular action potential. In this computational study, new mathematical formulations for the two nonlinear K+ conductances, IK1 and HERG, have been developed based upon experimental data obtained from electrophysiological studies of excised human ventricular tissue and\/or myocytes. The resulting mathematical model provides much improved simulations of the relative sizes and time courses of the K+ currents which modulate repolarization. Our new formulation represents an important first step in defining the mechanism(s) of repolarization of the membrane action potential in the human ventricle. Our overall goal is to understand the genesis of the T-wave of the human electrocardiogram.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nContributions of HERG K+ current to repolarization of the human ventricular action potential, Martin Fink, Denis Noble, Laszlo Virag, Andras Varro, and Wayne R.

A model of this process was built using the \"virtual cell,\" a general computational system for integrating experimental image, biochemical, and electrophysiological data. The model geometry was based on a cell for which the calcium wave had been experimentally recorded. The distributions of the relevant cellular components [InsP(3) receptor (InsP(3)R)], sarcoplasmic\/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pumps, bradykinin receptors, and ER] were based on 3D confocal immunofluorescence images. Wherever possible, known biochemical and electrophysiological data were used to constrain the model. The simulation closely matched the spatial and temporal characteristics of the experimental calcium wave. Predictions on different patterns of calcium signals after InsP(3) uncaging or for different cell geometries were confirmed experimentally, thus helping to validate the model. Models in which the spatial distributions of key components are altered suggest that initiation of the wave in the center of the neurite derives from an interplay of soma-biased ER distribution and InsP(3) generation biased toward the neurite. Simulations demonstrate that mobile buffers (like the indicator fura-2) significantly delay initiation and lower the amplitude of the wave. Analysis of the role played by calcium diffusion indicated that the speed of the wave is only slightly dependent on the ability of calcium to diffuse to and activate neighboring InsP(3) receptor sites.",

To address this problem, we developed a new ionic model using formulations of currents based on previous models and recent experimental data. Compared with existing models, the inward rectifier K(+) current (I(K1)) was decreased at depolarized potentials, the maximum conductance and rectification of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Kr)) were increased, and I(Kr) activation kinetics were slowed. The slow component of the delayed rectifier K(+) current (I(Ks)) was increased in magnitude and activation shifted to less positive voltages, and the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) was modified to produce a smaller, more rapidly inactivating current. Finally, a simplified form of intracellular calcium dynamics was adopted. In this model, APD alternans occurred at cycle lengths = 150-210 ms, with a maximum alternans amplitude of 39 ms. APD alternans was suppressed by decreasing I(Ca) magnitude or calcium-induced inactivation and by increasing the magnitude of I(K1), I(Kr), or I(Ks). These results establish an ionic basis for APD alternans, which should facilitate the development of pharmacological approaches to eliminating alternans.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIonic mechanism of electrical alternans, Jeffrey J.

We modeled the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent Akt pathway in PC12 cells on the basis of experimental results. We obtained counterintuitive results indicating that the sizes of the peak amplitudes of receptor and downstream effector phosphorylation were decoupled; weak, sustained EGF receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation, rather than strong, transient phosphorylation, strongly induced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, a molecule downstream of Akt. Using frequency response analysis, we found that a three-component Akt pathway exhibited the property of a low-pass filter and that this property could explain decoupling of the peak amplitudes of receptor phosphorylation and that of downstream effectors. Furthermore, we found that lapatinib, an EGFR inhibitor used as an anticancer drug, converted strong, transient Akt phosphorylation into weak, sustained Akt phosphorylation, and, because of the low-pass filter characteristics of the Akt pathway, this led to stronger S6 phosphorylation than occurred in the absence of the inhibitor. Thus, an EGFR inhibitor can potentially act as a downstream activator of some effectors.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDecoupling of receptor and downstream signals in the Akt pathway by its low-pass filter characteristics, Fujita KA, Toyoshima Y, Uda S, Ozaki Y, Kubota H, and Kuroda S, 2009, *Science Signaling*, 3, issue 132.

In this paper we investigate the possible role of the plasma membrane Na+\/Ca2+ exchange of the beta-cell in controlling the plateau fraction. We have extended different single-cell models to incorporate this Ca2+-activated electrogenic Ca2+ transporter. We find that the Na+\/Ca2+ exchange can provide a physiological mechanism to increase the plateau fraction as the glucose concentration is raised.

Here we show that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Msn2 is necessary and sufficient to promote the nucleocytoplasmic oscillations of the transcription factor. Because the NLS is controlled by protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, we use a computational model to investigate the possibility that the cAMP-PKA pathway could function as an oscillator driving the periodic shuttling of Msn2. The model indicates that sustained oscillations of cAMP can indeed occur in a range bounded by two critical values of stress intensity, owing to the negative feedback exerted by PKA on cAMP accumulation. We verify the predictions of the model in mutants by showing that suppressing this negative-feedback loop prevents the oscillatory shuttling but still promotes the stress-induced nuclear localization of Msn2.

More recently, models of the atria have started to emerge, and there is much interest in addressing sinoatrial node structure and function. METHODS AND RESULTS: We implemented a variety of one-dimensional sinoatrial models consisting of descriptions of central, transitional, and peripheral sinoatrial node cells, as well as rabbit or human atrial cells. These one-dimensional models were implemented using CMISS on an SGI Origin 2000 supercomputer. Intercellular coupling parameters recorded in experimental studies on sinoatrial node and atrial cell-pairs under-represent the electrotonic interactions that any cardiomyocyte would have in a multidimensional setting. Unsurprisingly, cell-to-cell coupling had to be scaled-up (by a factor of 5) in order to obtain a stable leading pacemaker site in the sinoatrial node center. Further critical parameters include the gradual increase in intercellular coupling from sinoatrial node center to periphery, and the presence of electrotonic interaction with atrial cells. Interestingly, the electrotonic effect of the atrium on sinoatrial node periphery is best described as opposing depolarization, rather than necessarily hyperpolarizing, as often assumed. CONCLUSION: Multicellular one-dimensional models of sinoatrial node and atrium can provide useful insight into the origin and spread of normal cardiac excitation. They require larger than \"physiologic\" intercellular conductivities in order to make up for a lack of \"anatomical\" spatial scaling. Multicellular models for more in-depth quantitative studies will require more realistic anatomico-physiologic properties.\n\n\n\n\nNote: There is a second variable which varies between models; version.

        "abstract":"We propose an integrated computational model for the network of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that controls the dynamics of the mammalian cell cycle. The model contains four Cdk modules regulated by reversible phosphorylation, Cdk inhibitors, and protein synthesis or degradation. Growth factors (GFs) trigger the transition from a quiescent, stable steady state to self-sustained oscillations in the Cdk network. These oscillations correspond to the repetitive, transient activation of cyclin D\/Cdk4\u20136 in G(1), cyclin E\/Cdk2 at the G(1)\/S transition, cyclin A\/Cdk2 in S and at the S\/G(2) transition, and cyclin B\/Cdk1 at the G(2)\/M transition. The model accounts for the following major properties of the mammalian cell cycle: (i) repetitive cell cycling in the presence of suprathreshold amounts of GF; (ii) control of cell-cycle progression by the balance between antagonistic effects of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the transcription factor E2F; and (iii) existence of a restriction point in G(1), beyond which completion of the cell cycle becomes independent of GF. The model also accounts for endoreplication. Incorporating the DNA replication checkpoint mediated by kinases ATR and Chk1 slows down the dynamics of the cell cycle without altering its oscillatory nature and leads to better separation of the S and M phases. The model for the mammalian cell cycle shows how the regulatory structure of the Cdk network results in its temporal self-organization, leading to the repetitive, sequential activation of the four Cdk modules that brings about the orderly progression along cell-cycle phases.",

It is presented to illustrate the process of physiological modeling using standard \"off the shelf\" technologies. The model simulates components of the HPA axis involved in the continuous secretion and elimination of cortisol, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). The physiological relations of these component pieces were modeled based on the current knowledge of their functioning. Rate constants, half lives, and receptor affinities were assigned values derived from the experimental literature. At its current level of development the model is able to accurately simulate the timing, magnitude and decay of the ACTH and cortisol concentration peaks resulting from the ovine-CRH stimulation test in normal and hypercortisolemic patients. The model will be used to predict the effects of lesions in different components of the HPA axis on the time course of cortisol and ACTH levels. We plan to use the model to explore the experimental conditions required to distinguish mechanisms underlying various disorders of the HPA axis, particularly depression. Efforts are currently underway to validate the model for a large variety of normal and pathological perturbations of the HPA axis.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA computer simulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, J.

Our aims were to: 1) simulate basic excitation-contraction coupling phenomena; 2) use realistic repolarizing K current densities; 3) reach steady-state. The model relies on the framework of the rabbit myocyte model previously developed by our group, with subsarcolemmal and junctional compartments where ion channels sense higher [Ca] vs. bulk cytosol. Ion channels and transporters have been modeled on the basis of the most recent experimental data from human ventricular myocytes. Rapidly and slowly inactivating components of I(to) have been formulated to differentiate between endocardial and epicardial myocytes. Transmural gradients of Ca handling proteins and Na pump were also simulated. The model has been validated against a wide set of experimental data including action potential duration (APD) adaptation and restitution, frequency-dependent increase in Ca transient peak and [Na](i). Interestingly, Na accumulation at fast heart rate is a major determinant of APD shortening, via outward shifts in Na pump and Na-Ca exchange currents. We investigated the effects of blocking K currents on APD and repolarization reserve: I(Ks) block does not affect the former and slightly reduces the latter; I(K1) blockade modestly increases APD and more strongly reduces repolarization reserve; I(Kr) blockers significantly prolong APD, an effect exacerbated as pacing frequency is decreased, in good agreement with experimental results in human myocytes. We conclude that this model provides a useful framework to explore excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms and repolarization abnormalities at the single myocyte level.",

This model is simulates the administration of L-dopa only, without benserazide added. This model was created using the paper equations supplemented by suggestions made by Dr. Holford, as the original code was not available. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nPURPOSE: To study the PK interaction of L-dopa\/benserazide in rats. METHODS: Male rats received a single oral dose of 80 mg\/kg L-dopa or 20 mg\/kg benserazide or 80\/20 mg\/kg L-dopa\/benserazide. Based on plasma concentrations the kinetics of L-dopa, 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD), benserazide, and its metabolite Ro 04-5127 were characterized by noncompartmental analysis and a compartmental model where total L-dopa clearance was the sum of the clearances mediated by amino-acid-decarboxylase (AADC), catechol-O-methyltransferase and other enzymes. In the model Ro 04-5127 inhibited competitively the L-dopa clearance by AADC. RESULTS: The coadministration of L-dopa\/benserazide resulted in a major increase in systemic exposure to L-dopa and 3-OMD and a decrease in L-dopa clearance. The compartmental model allowed an adequate description of the observed L-dopa and 3-OMD concentrations in the absence and presence of benserazide. It had an advantage over noncompartmental analysis because it could describe the temporal change of inhibition and recovery of AADC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first investigation where the kinetics of benserazide and Ro 04-5127 have been described by a compartmental model. The L-dopa\/benserazide model allowed a mechanism-based view of the L-dopa\/benserazide interaction and supports the hypothesis that Ro 04-5127 is the primary active metabolite of benserazide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA pharmacokinetic model to predict the PK interaction of L-dopa and benserazide in rats, Susan Grange, Nicholas H.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The body's primary stress management system is the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases. RESULTS: We developed a structured model of the HPA axis that includes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This model incorporates nonlinear kinetics of pituitary GR synthesis. The nonlinear effect arises from the fact that GR homodimerizes after cortisol activation and induces its own synthesis in the pituitary. This homodimerization makes possible two stable steady states (low and high) and one unstable state of cortisol production resulting in bistability of the HPA axis. In this model, low GR concentration represents the normal steady state, and high GR concentration represents a dysregulated steady state. A short stress in the normal steady state produces a small perturbation in the GR concentration that quickly returns to normal levels. Long, repeated stress produces persistent and high GR concentration that does not return to baseline forcing the HPA axis to an alternate steady state. One consequence of increased steady state GR is reduced steady state cortisol, which has been observed in some stress related disorders such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). CONCLUSION: Inclusion of pituitary GR expression resulted in a biologically plausible model of HPA axis bistability and hypocortisolism. High GR concentration enhanced cortisol negative feedback on the hypothalamus and forced the HPA axis into an alternative, low cortisol state. This model can be used to explore mechanisms underlying disorders of the HPA axis.",

The model hypothesizes two types of cross-bridge interactions: 1) cycling phosphorylated cross bridges and 2) noncycling dephosphorylated cross bridges (\"latch bridges\"). The major assumptions are that 1) Ca2+-dependent myosin phosphorylation is the only postulated regulatory mechanism, 2) each myosin head acts independently, and 3) latch bridges are formed by dephosphorylation of an attached cross bridge. Rate constants were resolved by fitting data on the time courses of myosin phosphorylation and stress development. Comparison of the rate constants indicates that latch-bridge detachment is the rate-limiting step. Model simulations predicted a hyperbolic dependence of steady-state stress on myosin phosphorylation, which corresponded with the experimental observation of high values of stress with low levels of phosphorylation in intact tissues. Model simulations also predicted the experimental observation that an initial phosphorylation transient only accelerates stress development, with no effect on the final steady-state levels of stress. Because the only Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism in this model was activation of myosin light chain kinase, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that myosin phosphorylation is both necessary and sufficient for the development of the latch state.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nCross-bridge phosphorylation and regulation of latch state in smooth muscle, Hai CM, Murphy RA, 1988, *American Journal of Physiology*, 254, C99-C106.

Each hair follicle successively goes through the anagen (A), catagen (C), telogen (T) and latency (L) phases that correspond, respectively, to growth, arrest and hair shedding before a new anagen phase is initiated. Long-term experimental observations in a group of ten male, alopecic and non-alopecic volunteers allowed determination of the characteristics of hair follicle cycles. On the basis of these observations, we previously proposed a follicular automaton model to simulate the dynamics of human hair cycles and the development of different patterns of alopecia [Halloy et al. (2000) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U.S.A.97, 8328-8333]. The automaton model is defined by a set of rules that govern the stochastic transitions of each follicle between the successive states A, T, L and the subsequent return to A. These transitions occur independently for each follicle, after time intervals given stochastically by a distribution characterized by a mean and a standard deviation. The follicular automaton model was shown to account both for the dynamical transitions observed in a single follicle, and for the behaviour of an ensemble of independently cycling follicles. Here, we extend these results and investigate additional properties of the model. We present a deterministic version of the follicular automaton. We show that numerical simulations of the stochastic version of the automaton yield steady-state level of follicles in the different phases which approach the levels predicted by the deterministic equations as the number of follicles progressively increases. Only the stochastic version can successfully reproduce the fluctuations of the fractions of follicles in each of the three phases, observed in small follicle populations. When the standard deviation is reduced or when the follicles become otherwise synchronized, e.g. by a periodic external signal inducing the transition of anagen follicles into telogen phase, large-amplitude oscillations occur in the fractions of follicles in the three phases. These oscillations are not observed in humans but are reminiscent of the phenomenon of moulting observed in a number of mammalian species.

In the present study, we examined heregulin (HRG)-induced signal transduction of ErbB4 receptor and found that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway negatively regulated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade by phosphorylating Raf-1 on Ser(259). As the time-course kinetics of Akt and ERK activities seemed to be transient and complex, we constructed a mathematical simulation model for HRG-induced ErbB4 receptor signalling to explain the dynamics of the regulation mechanism in this signal transduction cascade. The model reflected well the experimental results observed in HRG-induced ErbB4 cells and in other modes of growth hormone-induced cell signalling that involve Raf-Akt cross-talk. The model suggested that HRG signalling is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A as well as Raf-Akt cross-talk, and protein phosphatase 2A modulates the kinase activity in both the PI3K-Akt and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways.",

Structurally and functionally, the interactions of hGH with its receptor have been resolved in fine detail, such that hGH and hGH receptor variants can be practically engineered by either random or rational approaches to achieve significant changes in the free energies of binding. A somewhat unique feature of hGH action is its homodimerization of two hGH receptors, which is required for intracellular signaling and stimulation of cell proliferation, yet the potencies of hGH mutants in cell-based assays rarely correlate with their overall receptor-binding avidities. Here, a mathematical model of hGH-stimulated cell signaling is posed, accounting not only for binding interactions at the cell surface but induction of receptor endocytosis and downregulation as well. Receptor internalization affects ligand potency by imposing a limit on the lifetime of an active receptor complex, irrespective of ligand-receptor binding properties. The model thus explains, in quantitative terms, the numerous published observations regarding hGH receptor agonism and antagonism and challenges the interpretations of previous studies that have not considered receptor trafficking as a central regulatory mechanism in hGH signaling.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model of human growth hormone (hGH)-stimulated cell proliferation explains the efficacy of hGH variants as receptor agonists or antagonists, Jason M.

GnRH, released by the hypothalamus, stimulates the secretion of LH from the pituitary. If stimulus pulses are regular, LH response will follow a similar pattern. However, during application of GnRH at high frequencies or concentrations or with continuous application, the pituitary delivers a decreased release of LH (termed desensitization). The proposed mathematical model consists of a system of nonlinear differential equations and incorporates two possible mechanisms to account for this observed behavior: desensitized receptor and limited, available LH. Desensitization was provoked experimentally in vitro by using ovine pituitary cells in a perifusion system. The model was fit to resulting experimental data by using maximum-likelihood estimation. Consideration of smaller models revealed that the desensitized receptor is significant. Limited, available LH was significant in three of four chambers. Throughout, the proposed model was in excellent agreement with experimental data.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA mathematical model of luteinizing hormone release from ovine pituitary cells in perifusion, K.

The model consists of a closed-loop lumped-parameter representation of the circulation connected to set-point models of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. Model parameters are largely based on literature values. Model verification was performed by comparing the simulation output under baseline conditions and at different levels of orthostatic stress to sets of population-averaged hemodynamic data reported in the literature. On the basis of experimental evidence, we adjusted some model parameters to simulate experimental data. Orthostatic stress simulations are not statistically different from experimental data (two-sided test of significance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). Transient response characteristics of heart rate to tilt also compare well with reported data.

Here the authors demonstrate that a model of pyruvate distribution in Lactococcus lactis based on enzyme kinetics in combination with metabolic control analysis clearly indicates the key control points in the flux to acetoin and diacetyl, important flavour compounds. The model presented here (available at http:\/\/jjj.biochem.sun.ac.za\/wcfs.html) showed that the enzymes with the greatest effect on this flux resided outside the acetolactate synthase branch itself. Experiments confirmed the predictions of the model, i.e. knocking out lactate dehydrogenase and overexpressing NADH oxidase increased the flux through the acetolactate synthase branch from 0 to 75% of measured product formation rates.\n\n\n\n\n Metabolic engineering of lactic acid bacteria, the combined approach: kinetic modelling, metabolic control and experimental analysis, Marcel H.N.

Recently, it was shown that control of signalling cannot reside in a single gene product, and might well be dispersed over many components. Which of the reactions in these complex networks are most important, and how can the existing molecular information be used to understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas others are not? We implement a new method to help address such questions. We apply control analysis to a detailed kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase network. We determine the control of each reaction with respect to three biologically relevant characteristics of the output of this network: the amplitude, duration and integrated output of the transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We confirm that control is distributed, but far from randomly: a small proportion of reactions substantially control signalling. In particular, the activity of Raf is in control of all characteristics of the transient profile of ERK phosphorylation, which may clarify why Raf is an oncogene. Most reactions that really matter for one signalling characteristic are also important for the other characteristics. Our analysis also predicts the effects of mutations and changes in gene expression. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nControl of MAPK signalling: from complexity to what really matters, Jorrit J Hornberg, Bernd Binder, Frank J Bruggeman, Birgit Schoeberl, Reinhart Heinrich and Hans V Westerhoff, 2005, *Oncogene*, 26, 117-125.

        "abstract":"#### Model Status\n\n\nThis model has been built with the differential expressions of Houart's 1999 paper for various types of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations bassed on self-modulation of the Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate signal. The parameter values for this model are different for different types of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations. The parameter values used for this particular model were taken from Figure 2 on page 513 and reproduces the corresponding curves. Parameter values from pages 515 and 520 may be changed to reflect curves for Bursting, Chaos, Quasiperiodicity and Birhythmicity. The initial conditions have been set after allowing the model to run for approximately 5 minutes until steady state. This file is known to run in COR and OpenCell.\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\nWe investigate the various types of complex Ca2+ oscillations which can arise in a model based on the mechanism of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), that takes into account the Ca2+-stimulated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) by a 3-kinase. This model was previously proposed in the course of an investigation of plausible mechanisms capable of generating complex Ca2+ oscillations. Besides simple periodic behavior, this model for cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in nonexcitable cells shows complex oscillatory phenomena like bursting or chaos. We show that the model also admits a coexistence between two stable regimes of sustained oscillations (birhythmicity). The occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior is analysed by means of bifurcation diagrams. Complex oscillations are characterized by means of Poincare sections, power spectra and Lyapounov exponents. The results point to the role of self-modulation of the InsP3 signal by 3-kinase as a possible source for complex temporal patterns in Ca2+ signaling.\n\n\n\n Bursting, Chaos and Birhythmicity Originating from Self-modulation of the Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate Signal in a Model for Intracellular Ca2+ Oscillations, Houart G, Dupont G, Goldbeter A, 1999, *Bulletin of Mathematical Biology*\n , 61, 507-530 [PubMed ID: 17883229](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17883229)",

Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a highly cooperative enzyme, even though it was not assumed that any of the enzymes in the cascade were regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The stimulus\/response curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep as that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of 4-5, well in excess of that of the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK stimulus\/ response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like mitogenesis, cell fate induction, and oocyte maturation, where a cell switches from one discrete state to another.",

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: Computational biology is a powerful tool for elucidating arrhythmogenic mechanisms at the cellular level, where complex interactions between ionic processes determine behavior. A novel theoretical model of the canine ventricular epicardial action potential and calcium cycling was developed and used to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) transient (CaT) and action potential duration (APD) rate dependence. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) regulatory pathway was integrated into the model, which included a novel Ca(2+)-release formulation, Ca(2+) subspace, dynamic chloride handling, and formulations for major ion currents based on canine ventricular data. Decreasing pacing cycle length from 8000 to 300 ms shortened APD primarily because of I(Ca(L)) reduction, with additional contributions from I(to1), I(NaK), and late I(Na). CaT amplitude increased as cycle length decreased from 8000 to 500 ms. This positive rate\u2013dependent property depended on CaMKII activity. CONCLUSIONS: CaMKII is an important determinant of the rate dependence of CaT but not of APD, which depends on ion-channel kinetics. The model of CaMKII regulation may serve as a paradigm for modeling effects of other regulatory pathways on cell function.",

The resulting model agrees with almost all experimentally known stationary concentrations and metabolic fluxes, with the frequency of oscillation and with the majority of other experimentally known kinetic and dynamical variables.

        "abstract":"Receptor-mediated changes in cAMP production play an essential role in sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation of the electrical, mechanical, and metabolic activity of cardiac myocytes. However, responses to receptor activation cannot be easily ascribed to a uniform increase or decrease in cAMP activity throughout the entire cell. In this study, we used a computational approach to test the hypothesis that in cardiac ventricular myocytes the effects of \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(1)AR) and M(2) muscarinic receptor (M(2)R) activation involve compartmentation of cAMP. A model consisting of two submembrane (caveolar and extracaveolar) microdomains and one bulk cytosolic domain was created using published information on the location of \u03b2(1)ARs and M(2)Rs, as well as the location of stimulatory (G(s)) and inhibitory (G(i)) G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase isoforms inhibited (AC5\/6) and stimulated (AC4\/7) by G(i), and multiple phosphodiesterase isoforms (PDE2, PDE3, and PDE4). Results obtained with the model indicate that: 1), bulk basal cAMP can be high (\u223c1 \u03bcM) and only modestly stimulated by \u03b2(1)AR activation (\u223c2 \u03bcM), but caveolar cAMP varies in a range more appropriate for regulation of protein kinase A (\u223c100 nM to \u223c2 \u03bcM); 2), M(2)R activation strongly reduces the \u03b2(1)AR-induced increases in caveolar cAMP, with less effect on bulk cAMP; and 3), during weak \u03b2(1)AR stimulation, M(2)R activation not only reduces caveolar cAMP, but also produces a rebound increase in caveolar cAMP following termination of M(2)R activity. We conclude that compartmentation of cAMP can provide a quantitative explanation for several aspects of cardiac signaling.",

        "abstract":"Mathematical models are a repository of knowledge as well as research and teaching tools. Although action potential models have been developed for most regions of the heart, there is no model for the atrioventricular node (AVN). We have developed action potential models for single atrio-nodal, nodal, and nodal-His cells. The models have the same action potential shapes and refractoriness as observed in experiments. Using these models, together with models for the sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrial muscle, we have developed a one-dimensional (1D) multicellular model including the SAN and AVN. The multicellular model has slow and fast pathways into the AVN and using it we have analyzed the rich behavior of the AVN. Under normal conditions, action potentials were initiated in the SAN center and then propagated through the atrium and AVN. The relationship between the AVN conduction time and the timing of a premature stimulus (conduction curve) is consistent with experimental data. After premature stimulation, atrioventricular nodal reentry could occur. After slow pathway ablation or block of the L-type Ca(2+) current, atrioventricular nodal reentry was abolished. During atrial fibrillation, the AVN limited the number of action potentials transmitted to the ventricle. In the absence of SAN pacemaking, the inferior nodal extension acted as the pacemaker. In conclusion, we have developed what we believe is the first detailed mathematical model of the AVN and it shows the typical physiological and pathophysiological characteristics of the tissue. The model can be used as a tool to analyze the complex structure and behavior of the AVN.",

We have developed a mathematical model of a single cardiomyocyte to integrate various I-F relations, including alternans, by incorporating a conceptual CaMKII kinetics model into the SR Ca2+ handling model. Our model integrates I-F relations, such as the beat interval-dependent twitch force duration, restitution and potentiation, positive staircase phenomenon and alternans. We found that CaMKII affects more or less all I-F relations, and it is a key factor for integration of the various I-F relations in our model. Alternans arises, in the model, out of a steep relation between SR Ca2+ load and release, owing to SR load-dependent changes in the releasability of Ca2+ via the ryanodine receptor. Beat interval-dependent CaMKII activity, owing to its kinetic properties and amplifying effect on SR Ca2+ load dependency of Ca2+ release, replicated the beat interval dependency of alternans, as observed experimentally. Additionally, our model enabled reproduction of the effects of various interventions on alternans, such as the slowing or accelerating of Ca2+ release and\/or uptake. We conclude that a slow time-dependent factor, represented in the model by CaMKII, is important for the integration of I-F relations, including alternans, and that our model offers a useful tool for further analysis of the roles of integrative Ca2+ handling in myocardial I-F relations.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModulatory effect of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling and interval-force relations: a modelling study, Gentaro Iribe, Peter Kohl and Denis Noble, 2006, \n *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A*, 364, (1842), 1107-1133.

In this study, we simulated mutations in 2 genes\nlinked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, the first located in calsequestrin (CSQN2) and the\nsecond in the ryanodine receptor (RyR2). The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanistic basis for spontaneous\nCa2 release events that lead to delayed afterdepolarizations in affected patients. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) luminal\nCa2 sensing was incorporated into a model of the human ventricular myocyte, and CSQN2 mutations were modeled\nby simulating disrupted RyR2 luminal Ca2 sensing. In voltage-clamp mode, the mutant CSQN2 model recapitulated\nthe smaller calcium transients, smaller time to peak calcium transient, and accelerated recovery from inactivation seen\nin experiments. In current clamp mode, in the presence of stimulation, we observed delayed afterdepolarizations,\nsuggesting that accelerated recovery of RyR2 induced by impaired luminal Ca2 sensing underlies the triggered activity\nobserved in mutant CSQN2-expressing myocytes. In current-clamp mode, in a model of mutant RyR2 that is\ncharacterized by reduced FKBP12.6 binding to the RyR2 on stimulation, the impaired coupled gating characteristic\nof these mutations was modeled by reducing cooperativity of RyR2 activation.

The best agreement between the experimental and the mathematical modeling results was obtained when a postulate stating two types of cooperativity to regulate the calcium binding by troponin was introduced into the model. Cooperativity of the first type is due to the dependence of the affinity of troponin C for Ca2+ on the concentration of myosin crossbridges in the vicinity of a given troponin C.

We add membrane currents from the Luo-Rudy Phase II ventricular cell model to our description of Ca2+ handling to formulate a new model for ventricular action potentials and Ca2+ regulation. The model can simulate Ca2+ transients during an action potential similar to those seen experimentally. The subspace [Ca2+] rises more rapidly and reaches a higher level (10-30 microM) than the bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ (peak [Ca2+]i approximately 1 microM). Termination of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is predominately due to emptying of the SR, but is influenced by RyR adaptation. Because force generation is roughly proportional to peak myoplasmic Ca2+, we use [Ca2+]i in the model to explore the effects of pacing rate on force generation. The model reproduces transitions seen in force generation due to changes in pacing that cannot be simulated by previous models. Simulation of such complex phenomena requires an interplay of both RyR adaptation and the degree of SR Ca2+ loading. This model, therefore, shows improved behavior over existing models that lack detailed descriptions of subcellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms.",

In the present report we have developed an initial model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system self-regulatory activity. A four-dimensional non-linear differential equation model of the hormone secretion was formulated and used to analyze plasma cortisol levels in humans. The aim of this work was to explore in greater detail the role of this system in normal, homeostatic, conditions, since it is the first and unavoidable step in further understanding of the role of this complex neuroendocrine system in pathophysiological conditions.

Earlier models for GC kinetics are extended by explicitly modeling 1) the cell division history of centroblasts, 2) the Ag uptake by centrocytes, and 3) T cell dynamics. Allowing for T cell kinetics and T-B cell interactions, we study the role of GC T cells in GC kinetics, GC termination, and B cell selection. We find that GC T cells play a major role in GC formation, but that the maintenance of established GC reactions requires very few T cells only. The results therefore suggest that the termination of a GC reaction is largely caused by lack of Ag on the follicular dendritic cells and is hardly influenced by Th cells. Ag consumption by centrocytes is the major factor determining the decay rate of the antigenic stimulus during a GC reaction. Investigating the effect of the Ag dose on GC kinetics, we find that both the total size of the GC and its duration are hardly influenced by the initial amount of Ag. In the model this is due to a buffering effect by competition for limited T cell help and\/or competition between proliferating centroblasts. \n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Mathematical Model on Germinal Center Kinetics and Termination, Can Kesmir and Rob J.

However, the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state) levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nQuantification of Short Term Signaling by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, Boris N.

A prime example of such an intricate cell is the cardiac myocyte. For the predictive power of the cardiomyocyte models, it is vital to accurately describe the calcium transport mechanisms, since they essentially link the electrical activation to contractility. The removal of calcium from the cytoplasm takes place mainly by the Na(+)\/Ca(2+) exchanger, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). In the present study, we review the properties of SERCA, its frequency-dependent and beta-adrenergic regulation, and the approaches of mathematical modelling that have been used to investigate its function. Furthermore, we present novel theoretical considerations that might prove useful for the elucidation of the role of SERCA in cardiac function, achieving a reduction in model complexity, but at the same time retaining the central aspects of its function. Our results indicate that to faithfully predict the physiological properties of SERCA, we should take into account the calcium-buffering effect and reversible function of the pump. This 'uncomplicated' modelling approach could be useful to other similar transport mechanisms as well.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModelling Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium APTase and its Regulation in Cardiac Myocytes, Jussi T.

PTH targets bone-forming cells, osteoblasts, to increase expression of the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL), which then stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption. Intriguingly, whereas continuous administration of PTH decreases bone mass, intermittent PTH has an anabolic effect on bone, which was proposed to arise from direct effects of PTH on osteoblastic bone formation. However, antiresorptive therapies impair the ability of PTH to increase bone mass, indicating a complex role for osteoclasts in the process. We developed a mathematical model that describes the actions of PTH at a single site of bone remodeling, where osteoclasts and osteoblasts are regulated by local autocrine and paracrine factors. It was assumed that PTH acts only to increase the production of RANKL by osteoblasts. As a result, PTH stimulated osteoclasts upon application, followed by compensatory osteoblast activation due to the coupling of osteoblasts to osteoclasts through local paracrine factors. Continuous PTH administration resulted in net bone loss, because bone resorption preceded bone formation at all times. In contrast, over a wide range of model parameters, short application of PTH resulted in a net increase in bone mass, because osteoclasts were rapidly removed upon PTH withdrawal, enabling osteoblasts to rebuild the bone. In excellent agreement with experimental findings, increase in the rate of osteoclast death abolished the anabolic effect of PTH on bone. This study presents an original concept for the regulation of bone remodeling by PTH, currently the only approved anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model of paracrine interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts predicts anabolic action of parathyroid hormone on bone, Komarova SV, 2005, *Endocrinology*, 146, 3589-3595.

Disruptions in bone remodeling contribute to the pathogenesis of disorders such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and Paget's disease. Interactions among cells of osteoblast and osteoclast lineages are critical in the regulation of bone remodeling. We constructed a mathematical model of autocrine and paracrine interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts that allowed us to calculate cell population dynamics and changes in bone mass at a discrete site of bone remodeling. The model predicted different modes of dynamic behavior: a single remodeling cycle in response to an external stimulus, a series of internally regulated cycles of bone remodeling, or unstable behavior similar to pathological bone remodeling in Paget's disease. Parametric analysis demonstrated that the mode of dynamic behavior in the system depends strongly on the regulation of osteoclasts by autocrine factors, such as transforming growth factor beta. Moreover, simulations demonstrated that nonlinear dynamics of the system may explain the differing effects of immunosuppressants on bone remodeling in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the mathematical model revealed that interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts result in complex, nonlinear system behavior, which cannot be deduced from studies of each cell type alone. The model will be useful in future studies assessing the impact of cytokines, growth factors, and potential therapies on the overall process of remodeling in normal bone and in pathological conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model predicts a critical role for osteoclast autocrine regulation in the control of bone remodeling, Komarova SV, Smith RJ, Dixon SJ, Sims SM, Wahl LM, 2003, *Bone*, 33, 206-215.

However, the selective forces responsible for the emergence of genetic instability are not clear. We use mathematical models to determine the conditions under which selection favors instability, and when stable cells are advantageous. We take into account the processes of DNA damage, repair, cell cycle arrest, mutation, and death. We find that the rate of DNA damage can play a major role in this context. In particular, an increase in the rate of DNA damage can reverse the relative fitness of stable and unstable cells. In terms of cancer progression, we find the following results. If cells have intact apoptotic responses, stable cells prevail if the DNA hit rate is low. A high DNA hit rate can result in the selection of genetically unstable cells. This has implications for the induction of tumors by carcinogens. On the other hand, if cells are characterized by impaired apoptosis, we observe the opposite. Genetic instability is selected for if the DNA hit rate is low. A high DNA hit rate can select against instability and result in the persistence of stable cells. We propose that chemotherapy can be used to reverse the relative fitness of stable and unstable cells, such that unstable cells are the inferior competitors. This could result in the competitive exclusion of progressing cancer cells.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nEvolutionary dynamics of mutator phenotypes in cancer: implications for chemotherapy, Natalia L.

Currently no pharmacological formulations are available to promote bone formation, as needed for the treatment of osteoporosis. The paradoxical behavior of PTH confuses endocrinologists, thus, a model bone resorption or deposition dependent on the timing of PTH administration would de-mystify this behavior and provide the basis for logical drug formulation. We developed a mathematical model that accounts for net bone loss with continuous PTH administration and net bone formation with intermittent PTH administration, based on the differential effects of PTH on the osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations of cells. Bone, being a major reservoir of body calcium, is under the hormonal control of PTH. The overall effect of PTH is to raise plasma levels of calcium, partly through bone resorption. Osteoclasts resorb bone and liberate calcium, but they lack receptors for PTH. The preosteoblastic precursors and preosteoblasts possess receptors for PTH, upon which the hormone induces differentiation from the precursor to preosteoblast and from the preosteoblast to the osteoblast. The osteoblasts generate IL-6; IL-6 stimulates preosteoclasts to differentiate into osteoclasts. We developed a mathematical model for the differentiation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations in bone, using a delay time of 1 hour for differentiation of preosteoblastic precursors into preosteoblasts and 2 hours for the differentiation of preosteoblasts into osteoblasts. The ratio of the number of osteoblasts to osteoclasts indicates the net effect of PTH on bone resorption and deposition; the timing of events producing the maximum ratio would induce net bone deposition. When PTH is pulsed with a frequency of every hour, the preosteoblastic population rises and decreases in nearly a symmetric pattern, with 3.9 peaks every 24 hours, and 4.0 peaks every 24 hours when PTH is administered every 6 hours. Thus, the preosteoblast and osteoblast frequency depends more on the nearly constant value of the PTH, rather than on the frequency of the PTH pulsations. Increasing the time delay gradually increases the mean value for the number of osteoblasts. The osteoblastic population oscillates for all intermittent administrations of PTH and even when the PTH infusion is constant. The maximum ratio of osteoblasts to osteoclasts occurs when PTH is administered in pulses of every 6 hours. The delay features in the model bear most of the responsibility for the occurrence of these oscillations, because without the delay and in the presence of constant PTH infusions, no oscillations occur. However, with a delay, under constant PTH infusions, the model generates oscillations. The osteoblast oscillations express limit cycle behavior. Phase plane analysis show simple and complex attractors. Subsequent to a disturbance in the number of osteoblasts, the osteoblasts quickly regain their oscillatory behavior and cycle back to the original attractor, typical of limit cycle behavior. Further, because the model was constructed with dissipative and nonlinear features, one would expect ensuing oscillations to show limit cycle behavior. The results from our model, increased bone deposition with intermittent PTH administration and increased bone resorption with constant PTH administration, conforms with experimental observations and with an accepted explanation for osteoporosis.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nParathyroid hormone temporal effects on bone formation and resorption, Martin H.

Over the past decade a large body of data on the ionic currents underlying this pacemaker activity has been elucidated in patch-clamp experiments.

In the study by Kurata *et al.* described here, the aim is to develop an improved mathematical model of a single primary pacemaker cell of the rabbit SA node, in order to investigate the mechanisms underlying pacemaker generation. On the basis of the most recent experimental data, Kurata *et al.* updated the previously published models (see list above) in several ways:\n\n\n\n* A sustained inward current has been added (*Ist*).\n* The voltage- and Ca2+-dependent activation kinetics of the L-type calcium channel current (*ICa,L*) have been reformulated.\n* Expressions for the activation kinetics of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (*IKr*) have been updated.\n* Revised kinetic equations for two 4-AP sensitive currents (*Ito* and *Isus*) have been incorporated.\n* Voltage- and concentration-dependent kinetics of the Na+-K+ pump current (*INaK*) have been reformulated.\n* The subsarcolemmal space (see \n the figure\n below) as a diffusion barrier for intracellular Ca2+ has been added.\n\n\n\nThe model was validated by comparing simulation results with experimental data, and also by comparing them with those of previous mathematical models. The authors concluded that their model represented a significant improvement over previous models because it can:\n\n\n* Simulate whole cell voltage-clamp data for *ICa,L*, *IKr*, and *Ist*;\n* Reproduce the wave shapes of spontaneous action potentials and ionic currents during action potential clamp recordings; and\n* Mimic the effects of channel blockers or Ca 2+ buffers on pacemaker activity more accurately than the previous models.\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Dynamical description of sinoatrial node pacemaking: improved mathematical model for primary pacemaker cell](http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/283\/5\/H2074), Yasutaka Kurata, Ichiro Hisatome, Sunao Imanishi, and Toshishige Shibamoto, 2002, [*American Journal of Physiology*](http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/), 283, H2074-H2101.

This new model provides an improvement over previous models by introducing two nonlinear factors with physiological relevance: 1) a limit to gland size; 2) rejection of negative hormone concentrations. The result is that the new model is by far the most robust; e.g., it can tolerate at least -50% and +100% perturbations to any of its parameters. This high degree of robustness allows one, for the first time, to model features of the system such as circadian rhythm and response to hormone injections. In addition, relative to its closest predecessor, the model is simpler; it contains only about half of the parameters, and yet achieves more functions. The new model provides opportunities for teaching endocrinology within a biological or medical school context; it may also have applications in modeling and studying HPA axis disorders, for example, related to gland size dynamics, abnormal hormone levels, or stress influences. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling robust oscillatory behavior of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, Vadim Kyrylov, Liudmila A.

        "abstract":"We present a computational model for the mammalian circadian clock based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, Clock, and Rev-Erb \u03b1 genes. In agreement with experimental observations, the model can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness, characterized by an antiphase relationship between Per\/Cry\/Rev-Erb\u03b1 and Bmal1 mRNAs. Sustained oscillations correspond to the rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei. For other parameter values, damped oscillations can also be obtained in the model. These oscillations, which transform into sustained oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.",

This particular version of the model has been translated from equations 1a-1j (Drosophila).\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We examine theoretical models for circadian oscillations based on transcriptional regulation in Drosophila and Neurospora. For Drosophila, the molecular model is based on the negative feedback exerted on the expression of the per and tim genes by the complex formed between the PER and TIM proteins. For Neurospora, similarly, the model relies on the feedback exerted on the expression of the frq gene by its protein product FRQ. In both models, sustained rhythmic variations in protein and mRNA levels occur in continuous darkness, in the form of limit cycle oscillations. The effect of light on circadian rhythms is taken into account in the models by considering that it triggers degradation of the TIM protein in Drosophila, and frq transcription in Neurospora. When incorporating the control exerted by light at the molecular level, we show that the models can account for the entrainment of circadian rhythms by light-dark cycles and for the damping of the oscillations in constant light, though such damping occurs more readily in the Drosophila model. The models account for the phase shifts induced by light pulses and allow the construction of phase response curves. These compare well with experimental results obtained in Drosophila. The model for Drosophila shows that when applied at the appropriate phase, light pulses of appropriate duration and magnitude can permanently or transiently suppress circadian rhythmicity. We investigate the effects of the magnitude of light-induced changes on oscillatory behavior.

The model runs in both OpenCell and COR to recreate the published results. The units are consistent throughout.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: We propose a mathematical model explaining the interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, two cell types specialized in the maintenance of the bone integrity. Bone is a dynamic, living tissue whose structure and shape continuously evolves during life. It has the ability to change architecture by removal of old bone and replacement with newly formed bone in a localized process called remodeling. The model described here is based on the idea that the relative proportions of immature and mature osteoblasts control the degree of osteoclastic activity. In addition, osteoclasts control osteoblasts differentially depending on their stage of differentiation. Despite the tremendous complexity of the bone regulatory system and its fragmentary understanding, we obtain surprisingly good correlations between the model simulations and the experimental observations extracted from the literature. The model results corroborate all behaviors of the bone remodeling system that we have simulated, including the tight coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the catabolic effect induced by continuous administration of PTH, the catabolic action of RANKL, as well as its reversal by soluble antagonist OPG. The model is also able to simulate metabolic bone diseases such as estrogen deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, senescence and glucocorticoid excess. Conversely, possible routes for therapeutic interventions are tested and evaluated. Our model confirms that anti-resorptive therapies are unable to partially restore bone loss, whereas bone formation therapies yield better results. The model enables us to determine and evaluate potential therapies based on their efficacy. In particular, the model predicts that combinations of anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies provide significant benefits compared with monotherapy, especially for certain type of skeletal disease. Finally, the model clearly indicates that increasing the size of the pool of preosteoblasts is an essential ingredient for the therapeutic manipulation of bone formation. This model was conceived as the first step in a bone turnover modeling platform. These initial modeling results are extremely encouraging and lead us to proceed with additional explorations into bone turnover and skeletal remodeling.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling the interactions between osteoblast and osteoclast activities in bone remodeling, Vincent Lemaire, Frank L.

A model is constructed that incorporates the regulation of metabotropic receptor activity, the G-protein cascade and the Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol. It is subsequently used to reproduce observations on the extent of desensitization and sequestration of the P(2)Y(2) receptor following its activation by uridine triphosphate (UTP). The theory predicts the dependence on agonist concentration of the change in the number of receptors in the membrane as well as the time course of disappearance of receptors from the plasmalemma, upon exposure to agonist. In addition, the extent of activation and desensitization of the receptor, using the calcium transients in cells initiated by exposure to agonist, is also predicted. Model predictions show the significance of membrane PIP(2) depletion and resupply on the time course of IP(3) and Ca2+ levels.

Initially, a gastrointestinal absorption term for glucose is utilized to effect the glucose absorption by the intestine and the subsequent release of glucose into the bloodstream, taking place at a given initial rate and falling off exponentially with time. An analysis of the model is carried out by the singular perturbation technique in order to derive boundary conditions on the system parameters which identify, in particular, the existence of limit cycles in our model system consistent with the oscillatory patterns often observed in clinical data. We then utilize a sinusoidal term to incorporate the temporal absorption of glucose in order to study the responses in the patients under ambulatory-fed conditions. A numerical investigation is carried out in this case to construct a bifurcation diagram to identify the ranges of parametric values for which chaotic behavior can be expected, leading to interesting biological interpretations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling insulin kinetics: responses to a single oral glucose administration or ambulatory-fed conditions.

After pioneering work traced back to the 1960s, several mathematical models have been proposed during the last decade to model these ultradian oscillations as well as the metabolic system producing them. These currently existing models still lack some of the key physiological aspects of the glucose-insulin system. Applying the mass conservation law, we introduce two explicit time delays and propose a more robust alternative model for better understanding the glucose-insulin endocrine metabolic regulatory system and the ultradian insulin secretory oscillations for the cases of continuous enteral nutrition and constant glucose infusion. We compare the simulation profiles obtained from this two time delay model with those from the other existing models. As a result, we notice many unique features of this two delay model. Based on our intensive simulations, we suspect that one of the possibly many causes of ultradian insulin secretion oscillations is the time delay of the insulin secretion stimulated by the elevated glucose concentration.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling the glucose-insulin regulatory system and ultradian insulin secretory oscillations with two explicit time delays, Jiaxu Li, Yang Kuang, and Clinton C.

Available biophysical data have been incorporated into the model to quantify the specific ultrastructural morphology, intracellular ion buffering, and time- and voltage-dependent currents and transport mechanisms of the rabbit atrial cell. When possible, mathematical expressions describing ionic currents identified in rabbit atrium are based on whole cell voltage-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rabbit atrial myocytes. This membrane model is coupled to equations describing Na+, K+, and Ca2+ homeostasis, including the uptake and release of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca2+ buffering. The resulting formulation can accurately simulate the whole cell voltage-clamp data on which it is based and provides fits to a family of rabbit atrial cell action potentials obtained at 35 degrees C over a range of stimulus rates (0.2-3.0 Hz).

At the cellular level, alternans involves beat-to-beat oscillation of the action potential (AP) and possibly Ca(2+) transient (CaT). Because of experimental difficulty in independently controlling the Ca(2+) and electrical subsystems, mathematical modelling provides additional insights into mechanisms and causality. Pacing protocols were conducted in a canine ventricular myocyte model with the following results: 1. (I) CaT alternans results from refractoriness of the SR Ca(2+) release system; alternation of the L-type calcium current (I(Ca)(()(L)())) has a negligible effect; (II) CaT-AP coupling during late AP occurs through the sodium-calcium exchanger (I(NaCa)) and underlies APD alternans; (III) Increased Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity extends the range of CaT and APD alternans to slower frequencies and increases alternans magnitude; its decrease suppresses CaT and APD alternans, exerting an antiarrhythmic effect; (IV). Increase of the rapid delayed rectifier current (I(Kr)) also suppresses APD alternans, but without suppressing CaT alternans. Thus, CaMKII inhibition eliminates APD alternans by eliminating its cause (CaT alternans), while I(Kr) enhancement does so by weakening CaT-APD coupling. The simulations identify combined CaMKII inhibition and I(Kr) enhancement as a possible antiar-rhythmic intervention.",

The work extends a recent model of the pituitary GH system, adding representations of the hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin neurones, each modelled as a single synchronised unit. An unpatterned stochastic input drives the GHRH neurones generating pulses of GHRH release that trigger GH pulses. Delayed feedback from GH results in increased somatostatin release, which inhibits both GH secretion and GHRH release, producing an overall pattern of 3-h pulses of GH secretion that is very similar to the secretory profile observed in male rats. Rather than directly stimulating somatostatin release, GH feedback triggers a priming effect, increasing releasable stores of somatostatin. Varying this priming effect to reduce the effect of GH can reproduce the less pulsatile form of GH release observed in the female rat. The model behaviour is tested by comparison with experimental observations with a range of different experimental protocols involving GHRH injections and somatostatin and GH infusion.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModelling the hypothalamic control of growth hormone secretion, D.

Using two-microelectrode voltage clamp, we have characterized the presteady-state and steady-state kinetics of SGLT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The kinetic properties of the steady-state sugar-evoked currents as a function of external Na and a-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (aMG) concentrations were consistent with an ordered, simultaneous transport model in which Na binds first. Na binding was voltage-dependent and saturated with hyperpolarizing voltages. Phlorizin was a potent inhibitor of the sugar-evoked currents (Ki ~10 mM) and blocked an inward Na current in the absence of sugar. SGLT2 exhibited Na-dependent presteadystate currents with time constants 3-7 ms. Charge movements were described by Boltzmann relations with apparent valence ~1 and maximal charge transfer ~11 nC, and were reduced by the addition of sugar or phlorizin. The differences between SGLT1 and SGLT2 were that (i) the apparent affinity constant (K0.5) for aMG (~3 mM) was an order of magnitude higher for SGLT2; (ii) SGLT2 excluded galactose, suggesting discrete sugar binding; (iii) K0.5 for Na was lower in SGLT2; and (iv) the Hill coefficient for Na was 1 for SGLT2 but 2 for SGLT1. Simulations of the six-state kinetic model previously proposed for SGLT1 indicated that many of the kinetic properties observed in SGLT2 are expected by simply reducing the Na\/glucose coupling from 2 to 1.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n Biophysical Characteristics of the Pig Kidney Na\/Glucose Cotransporter SGLT2 Reveal a Common Mechanism for SGLT1 and SGLT2, M.

The aim of this study was to develop such a model. Using an existing rabbit ventricular action potential model, we modified the L-type calcium (Ca) current (I(Ca,L)) and Ca(i) cycling formulations based on new experimental patch-clamp data obtained in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, using the perforated patch configuration at 35\u201337\u00b0C. Incorporating a minimal seven-state Markovian model of I(Ca,L) that reproduced Ca- and voltage-dependent kinetics in combination with our previously published dynamic Ca(i) cycling model, the new model replicates experimentally observed action potential duration and Ca(i) transient alternans at rapid heart rates, and accurately reproduces experimental action potential duration restitution curves obtained by either dynamic or S1S2 pacing.",

        "abstract":"Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases (Ca(2+) clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger current (I(NCX)). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited cardiac pacemaker cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca(2+) cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca(2+) releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-based Ca(2+) clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD I(NCX) over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e.g., L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and\/or hyperpolarization-activated (\u201cfunny\u201d) current (I(f)) conductances]. The system Ca(2+) clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca(2+) fluxes, which optimize cell Ca(2+) balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca(2+) release and late DD I(NCX) as SR Ca(2+) pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1.8\u20134.6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca(2+) clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca(2+) clock is disabled, the system parametric space for fail-safe SANC operation considerably shrinks: without rhythmic late DD I(NCX) ignition signals membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca(2+) clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function. A synergism of the coupled function of Ca(2+) and membrane clocks confers fail-safe SANC operation at greatly varying rates.",

Simple calcium oscillations represent the most common pattern and many mathematical models have been published to describe this type of oscillation. On the other hand, relatively few theoretical studies have been proposed to give an explanation of complex intracellular calcium oscillations, such as bursting and chaos. In this paper, we develop a new possible mechanism for complex calcium oscillations based on the interplay between three calcium stores in the cell: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and cytosolic proteins. The majority ( approximately 80%) of calcium released from the ER is first very quickly sequestered by mitochondria. Afterwards, a much slower release of calcium from the mitochondria serves as the calcium supply for the intermediate calcium exchanges between the ER and the cytosolic proteins causing bursting calcium oscillations. Depending on the permeability of the ER channels and on the kinetic properties of calcium binding to the cytosolic proteins, different patterns of complex calcium oscillations appear. With our model, we are able to explain simple calcium oscillations, bursting and chaos. Chaos is also observed for calcium oscillations in the bursting mode.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nComplex calcium oscillations and the role of mitochondria and cytosolic proteins, Marko Marhl, Thomas Haberichter, Milan Brumen and Reinhart Heinrich, 2000, *Biosystems*, 57, 75-86.

Analysis of the model has shown that AdoMet metabolism can operate under two different modes. The first, with low metabolic rate and low AdoMet concentration, serves predominantly to supply the cell with AdoMet, the substrate for various cellular methylation reactions. The second, with high metabolic rate and high AdoMet concentration, provides an avenue for cleavage of excess methionine and can serve as a source of cysteine when its increased synthesis is necessary. The switch that triggers interconversion between the \"low\" and \"high\" modes is methionine concentration. Under a certain set of parameters both modes may coexist. This behavior results from the kinetic properties of (i) the two isoenzymes of AdoMet synthetase, MATI and MATIII, that catalyse AdoMet production; one is inhibited by AdoMet, whereas the other is activated by it, and (ii) glycine-N-methyltransferase that displays highly cooperative kinetics that is different from that of other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. Thus, the model provides an explanation for how different cellular needs are met by regulation of this pathway. The model also correctly identifies a critical role for glycine N-methyltransferase in depleting excess methionine in the high mode, thus avoiding the toxicity associated with elevated levels of this essential amino acid. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Substrate Switch: A New Mode of Regulation in the Methionine Metabolic Pathway, Michael V.

Initial rate analysis was performed by hyperbolic regression of initial rates using the program HYPERFIT. Glyoxalase I exhibited saturation kinetics on 0.05-2.5 mM hemithioacetal concentration range, with kinetic parameters Km 0.53 +\/- 0.07 mM and V (3.18 +\/- 0.16) x 10(-2) mM.min(-1).

The kinetic parameters of both enzymes were also estimated by nonlinear regression of progress curves using the raw absorbance data and integrated differential rate equations with the program GEPASI. Several optimization methods were used to minimize the sum of squares of residuals. The best parameter fit for the glyoxalase I reaction was obtained with a single curve analysis, using the irreversible Michaelis-Menten model. The kinetic parameters obtained, Km 0.62 +\/- 0.18 mM and V (2.86 +\/- 0.01) x 10(-2) mM.min(-1), were in agreement with those obtained by initial rate analysis. The results obtained for glyoxalase II, using either the irreversible Michaelis-Menten model or a phenomenological reversible hyperbolic model, showed a high correlation of residuals with time and\/or high values of standard deviation associated with Km.

We have previously suggested that time-resolved somatic complementation (TRSC) analysis with such mutants may be used to probe network architecture and dynamics. By computer simulation it is now shown how and under which conditions the regulatory hierarchy of genes can be determined experimentally. A kinetic model of the sporulation control network is developed, which is then used to demonstrate how the mechanisms of TRSC can be understood and simulated at the kinetic level. On the basis of theoretical considerations, experimental parameters that determine whether functional complementation of two mutations will occur are identified. It is also shown how gene dosage-effect relationships can be employed for network analysis. The theoretical framework provided may be used to systematically analyze network structure and dynamics through time-resolved somatic complementation studies.

Although the behaviours of single ion channels have been extensively studied experimentally, ionic current interactions make it difficult to deduce their individual roles in membrane excitability.

In addition, the compound *Kyoto Model* of Matsuoka *et al.* incorporates the Negroni and Lascano (1996) model of cardiac muscle contraction, allowing simulation of sarcomere shortening, and also, the gating model of Shirokov *et al.* is used for both the fast Na+ and L-type Ca2+ channels. \n\n\n\n\nNew experimental data are included, such as new kinetics of the inward rectifier K+ channel, the delayed rectifier K+ channel, and the sustained inward current (for more details on the reaction kinetics, see figure 3 below).

Coarse-grained biochemical models, called reduced-order models (ROMs), consisting of essential biochemical mechanisms are more useful for computational analysis and for studying important features of a biochemical network. The authors present a novel method to model-reduction by identifying potentially important parameters using multidimensional sensitivity analysis. A ROM is generated for the GTPase-cycle module of m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, Gq, and regulator of G-protein signalling 4 (a GTPase-activating protein or GAP) starting from a detailed model of 48 reactions. The resulting ROM has only 17 reactions. The ROM suggested that complexes of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and GAP \u2013 which were proposed in the detailed model as a hypothesis \u2013 are required to fit the experimental data. Models previously published in the literature are also simulated and compared with the ROM. Through this comparison, a minimal ROM, that also requires complexes of GPCR and GAP, with just 15 parameters is generated. The proposed reduced-order modelling methodology is scalable to larger networks and provides a general framework for the reduction of models of biochemical systems.",

The simulation consisted of a forward dynamic 3-D musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity, scaled to represent a specific subject. Inputs of the model were the initial position and velocity of the skeletal elements, and the muscle stimulation patterns. Outputs of the model were movement and ground reaction forces, as well as resultant 3-D forces and moments acting across the knee joint. An optimization method was established to find muscle stimulation patterns that best reproduced the subject's movement and ground reaction forces during a sidestepping task. The optimized model produced movements and forces that were generally within one standard deviation of the measured subject data. Resultant knee joint loading variables extracted from the optimized model were comparable to those reported in the literature. The ability of the model to successfully predict the subject's response to altered initial conditions was quantified and found acceptable for use of the model to investigate the effect of altered neuromuscular control on knee joint loading during sidestepping. Monte Carlo simulations (N = 100,000) using randomly perturbed initial kinematic conditions, based on the subject's variability, resulted in peak anterior force, valgus torque and internal torque values of 378 N, 94 Nm and 71 Nm, respectively, large enough to cause ACL rupture. We conclude that the procedures described in this paper were successful in creating valid simulations of normal movement, and in simulating injuries that are caused by perturbed neuromuscular control.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment and validation of a 3-D model to predict knee joint loading during dynamic movement, S.G.

We have proposed that the Phase 1 response results from the combined depolarizing influences of potassium channel closure and an inward, nonselective cation current (ICRAN) that activates as intracellular calcium stores empty during exposure to basal glucose (Bertram et al., 1995). The stores refill during Phase 1, deactivating ICRAN and allowing steady-state bursting to commence. We support this hypothesis with additional simulations and experimental results indicating that Phase 1 duration is sensitive to the filling state of intracellular calcium stores. First, the duration of the Phase 1 transient increases with duration of prior exposure to basal (2.8 mM) glucose, reflecting the increased time required to fill calcium stores that have been emptying for longer periods. Second, Phase 1 duration is reduced when islets are exposed to elevated K+ to refill calcium stores in the presence of basal glucose. Third, when extracellular calcium is removed during the basal glucose exposure to reduce calcium influx into the stores, Phase 1 duration increases. Finally, no Phase 1 is observed following hyperpolarization of the beta-cell membrane with diazoxide in the continued presence of 11 mm glucose, a condition in which intracellular calcium stores remain full. Application of carbachol to empty calcium stores during basal glucose exposure did not increase Phase 1 duration as the model predicts. Despite this discrepancy, the good agreement between most of the experimental results and the model predictions provides evidence that a calcium release-activated current mediates the Phase 1 electrical response of the pancreatic beta-cell.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nEvidence That Calcium Release-activated Current Mediates the Biphasic Electrical Activity of Mouse Pancreatic *Journal name*, edition, firstpage-lastpage.

The results indicate that, under normal conditions, Ca(2+) binding by low-affinity ATP and diffusion of CaATP may affect the amplitude and time course of intracellular Ca(2+) signals. The model also suggests that a fall in ATP\/ADP ratio significantly reduces sarcoplasmic Ca(2+) content, increases diastolic Ca(2+), lowers systolic Ca(2+), increases Ca(2+) influx through L-type channels, and decreases the efficiency of the Na(+)\/Ca(2+) exchanger in extruding Ca(2+) during periodic voltage-clamp stimulation. The analysis suggests that the most important reason for these changes during metabolic inhibition is the down-regulation of the sarcoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase pump by reduced diastolic MgATP levels. High Ca(2+) concentrations developed near the membrane might have a greater influence on Mg(2+), ATP, and ADP concentrations than that of the lower Ca(2+) concentrations in the bulk myoplasm.

Based on real morphological and electrophysiological data, the model assumes that: the functional unit is an electromyogenic syncytium; the kinetics of L-type Ca2+, T-type Ca2+, Ca2+-activated K+, voltage dependent K+and Cl-channels determine the electrical activity of the functional unit; the enteric nervous system is satisfactorily represented by an efferent cholinergic neuron that provides an excitatory input to the functional unit through receptor-linked L-type Ca2+channels and by an afferent pathway composed of the primary and secondary sensory neurons; the dynamics of propagation of the wave of depolarization along the unmyelinated nerve axons satisfy the Hodgkin-Huxley model; the electrical activity of the neural soma reflects the interaction of N-type Ca2+channels, Ca2+-activated K+and voltage dependent Na+, K+and Cl-channels; the smooth muscle syncytium of the locus is a null-dimensional contractile system. With the proposed model the dynamics of active force generation are determined entirely by the concentration of cytosolic calcium. The model describes: the mechanical excitation of the free nerve endings of the mechanoreceptor of the receptive field of the pathway; the electrical processes of the propagation of excitation along the afferent and efferent neural circuits; the chemical mechanisms of nerve-pulse transmission at the synaptic zones; the slow wave and bursting type electrical activity; cytosolic calcium concentration; the dynamics of active force generation. Numerical simulations have shown that the model can display different electrical patterns and mechanical responses of the locus. The results show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of experiments conducted on the small intestine.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Simulation of Motility Patterns of the Small Bowel. 1.

We used the latch regulation scheme of Hai and Murphy (Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 255:C86-C94, 1988) integrated with Huxley's sliding filament theory of muscle contraction. This analysis showed that imposed length fluctuations decrease the mean number of attached bridges, depress muscle force and stiffness, and increase force-length hysteresis. At frequencies >0.1 Hz, the bond-length distribution of slowly cycling latch bridges changed little over the stretch cycle and contributed almost elastically to muscle force, but the rapidly cycling cross-bridge distribution changed substantially and dominated the hysteresis. By contrast, at frequencies <0.033 Hz this behavior was reversed: the rapid cycling cross-bridge distribution changed little, effectively functioning as a constant force generator, while the latch bridge bond distribution changed substantially and dominated the stiffness and hysteresis. The analysis showed the dissociation of force\/length hysteresis and cross-bridge cycling rates when strain amplitude exceeds 3%; that is, there is only a weak coupling between net external mechanical work and the ATP consumption required for cycling cross-bridges during the oscillatory steady state. Although these results are specific to airway smooth muscle, the approach generalizes to other smooth muscles subjected to cyclic length fluctuations.",

This allows us to determine rather completely how the parameters in the model affect its behavior which in turn provides insight into the effects of the many parameters in more realistic models. (3) It naturally gives rise to a one-dimensional map which specifies the action potential duration as a function of the previous diastolic interval. For certain parameter values, this map exhibits a new phenomenon--subcritical alternans--that does not occur for the commonly used exponential map.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n A two-current model for the dynamics of cardiac membrane, Colleen C.

Assuming that the variation among cells with respect to this 'intracellular' delay can be approximated by a gamma distribution, a high flexible distribution that can mimic a variety of biologically plausible delays, we provide analytical solutions for the expected decline in plasma virus concentration after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy with one or more protease inhibitors. We then use the model to investigate whether the parameters that characterize viral dynamics can be identified from biological data. Using non-linear least-squares regression to fit the model to simulated data in which the delays conform to a gamma distribution, we show that good estimates for free viral clearance rates, infected cell death rates, and parameters characterizing the gamma distribution can be obtained. For simulated data sets in which the delays were generated using other biologically plausible distributions, reasonably good estimates for viral clearance rates, infected cell death rates, and mean delay times can be obtained using the gamma-delay model. For simulated data sets that include added simulated noise, viral clearance rate estimates are not as reliable. If the mean intracellular delay is known, however, we show that reasonable estimates for the viral clearance rate can be obtained by taking the harmonic mean of viral clearance rate estimates from a group of patients. These results demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate distributed intracellular delays into existing models for HIV dynamics and to use these refined models to estimate the half-life of free virus from data on the decline in HIV-1 RNA following treatment. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nInfluence of Delayed Viral Production on Viral Dynamics in HIV-1 Infected Patients, John E.

Repolarization abnormalities such as action potential (AP) prolongation and early afterdeploarizations (EAD) are often observed in vitro upon pharmacological interventions. However, because drugs do not act on only one defined target, it is often difficult to fully explain the mechanisms of action and their potential arrhythmogenicity. Computational models, when appropriately detailed and validated, can be used to gain mechanistic insights into the mechanisms of action of certain drugs. Nevertheless, no model of Purkinje electrophysiology that is able to reproduce characteristic Purkinje responses to drug-induced changes in ionic current conductances such as AP prolongation and EAD generation currently exists. In this study, a novel biophysically detailed model of rabbit Purkinje electrophysiology was developed by integration of data from voltage-clamp and AP experimental recordings. Upon validation, we demonstrate that the model reproduces many key electrophysiological properties of rabbit Purkinje cells. These include: AP morphology and duration, both input resistance and rate dependence properties as well as response to hyperkalemia. Pharmacological interventions such as inward rectifier K+ current and rapid delayed rectifier K+ current block as well as late Na+ current increase result in significant AP changes. However, enhanced L-type Ca2+ current (iCaL) dominates in EAD genesis in Purkinje fibers. In addition, iCaL inactivation dynamics and intercellular coupling in tissue strongly modulate EAD formation. We conclude that EAD generation in Purkinje cells is mediated by an increase in iCaL and modulated by its inactivation kinetics.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n[Ionic mechanisms of electrophysiological properties and repolarization abnormalities in rabbit Purkinje fibers](http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21335469), Corrias A, Giles W, Rodriguez B, 2011, [American Journal of Physiology Heart and Circulatory Physiology](http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/), 2011 May;300(5):H1806-13.

The equations (S-5, S-6, S-7) have been multiplied by 1*e*\u2005\u2212\u200515 for unit conversion.\n3.

The reference temperature for *I**CaL* is 310 K, while *I**CaT* is constructed based on 297 K. The reference temperatures for other currents are 297 K.\n4. The intracellular *Ca*2\u2005+ concentrations terms have been removed from the equations (S-67,..., S-70) and (S-75,..., S-78).\n5. For voltage clamp experiments, as the clamping values for intracellular concentrations of *Ca*2\u2005+*i*, *Na*+*i* and *K*+*i* were not specified in the paper, we use the initial values that the author used in their CellML model.\n6. For clamped *I**CaL* in Figure 2, the *\u03b8* and *\u03b4* are set to 0 to switch off the *Ca*2\u2005+*i* dependency.\n7. The holding voltage for Figure 4 was not specified, and we use \u2005\u2212\u200570 mV.\n8. Using the default parameters provided in the paper except for the above modification, Figure 4, 5, 8, 9, 13 can be reproduced with marginal difference, while the difference becomes significant at less negative clamping voltages in Figure 2, 3, and 6.

The IP3 - calcineurin pathway plays an important role in stimulating the transcription factor NFAT which binds to DNA cooperatively with other hypertrophic transcription factors. Using available kinetic data we construct a mathematical model of the IP3 signal production system after stimulation by a hypertrophic {alpha}-adrenergic agonist (endothelin-1), in the mouse atrial cardiac myocyte. We use a global sensitivity analysis to identify key controlling parameters with respect to the resultant IP3 transient; including the phosphorylation of cell-membrane receptors, the ligand strength and binding kinetics to precoupled (with G{alpha}GDP) receptor, and the kinetics associated with precoupling the receptors. We show that the kinetics associated with the receptor system contribute to the behaviour of the system to a great extent, with precoupled receptors driving the response to extracellular ligand. Finally, by reparameterising for a second hypertrophic {alpha}-adrenergic agonist, angiotensin-II, we show that differences in key receptor kinetic and membrane density parameters are sufficient to explain different observed IP3 transients in essentially the same pathway. \n\n\n*Abstract reproduced from Cooling et al., Biophysical Journal 93, 2007, with permission.*\n\n\nThis model of the NFAT cycling system is described in more depth in the original paper which is cited below:\n\n\nModeling hypertrophic IP3 transients in the cardiac myocyte, Michael Cooling, Peter Hunter and Edmund J.

The extracellular ligand (L) binds to receptors (R), whether precoupled with GaGDP (Gd, yielding Rlg) or not (Rl). Fully activated receptors (Rlg) release GaGTP (Gt), which, along with calcium (Ca), stimulates PLCb (P). In the unstimulated state, PLCb-Ca21 (Pc) hydrolyzes PIP2 to produce IP3 via reaction R14. When stimulated, PLCb-Ca21-GaGTP (Pcg) hydrolyses PIP2 at a faster rate via reaction R15. Free IP3 is degraded via reaction R16.*\n\n\n\n Related models: A more modular version of this model is available at [Modeling Biological Modularity with CellML](http:\/\/models.cellml.org\/workspace\/cooling_hunter_crampin_CellML_2008).",

We model the interaction between naive T cells, effector T cells, and CML cancer cells in the body, using a system of ordinary differential equations which gives rates of change of the three cell populations. One of the difficulties in modeling CML is the scarcity of experimental data which can be used to estimate parameters values. To compensate for the resulting uncertainties, we use Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) on large ranges of possible parameter values in our analysis. A major goal of this work is the determination of parameters which play a critical role in remission or clearance of the cancer in the model. Our analysis examines 12 parameters, and identifies two of these, the growth and death rates of CML, as critical to the outcome of the system. Our results indicate that the most promising research avenues for treatments of CML should be those that affect these two significant parameters (CML growth and death rates), while altering the other parameters should have little effect on the outcome.\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nA mathematical model for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and T cell interaction, Helen Moore and Natasha K.

        "abstract":"Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.",

A two-dimensional musculoskeletal model which consisted of four rigid segments, three joints, and six Hill-type muscle models, representing the six major muscles and muscle groups in the lower extremity that contribute to jumping performance, was trained systematically. Maximum isometric muscle force, maximum muscle shortening velocity, and maximum muscle activation, which were manipulated to simulate the effects of strength training, all had substantial effects on jumping performance. Part of the increase in jumping performance could be explained solely by the interaction between the three neuromuscular parameters. It appeared that the most effective way to improve jumping performance was to train the knee extensors among all lower extremity muscles. For the model to fully benefit from any training effects of the neuromuscular system, it was necessary to continue to reoptimize the muscle coordination, in particular after the strength training sessions that focused on increasing maximum isometric muscle force. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\nEffects of Neuromuscular Strength Training on Vertical Jumping Performance - A Computer Simulation Study, Akinori Nagano and Karin G.M.

For example, data from experiments in which HIV-infected patients are given potent antiretroviral drugs that perturb the infection process have been used to estimate kinetic parameters underlying HIV infection. Many of the models used to analyze data have assumed drug treatments to be completely efficacious and that upon infection a cell instantly begins producing virus. We consider a model that allows for less then perfect drug effects and which includes a delay in the initiation of virus production. We present detailed analysis of this delay differential equation model and compare the results to a model without delay. Our analysis shows that when drug efficacy is less than 100%, as may be the case in vivo, the predicted rate of decline in plasma virus concentration depends on three factors: the death rate of virus producing cells, the efficacy of therapy, and the length of the delay. Thus, previous estimates of infected cell loss rates can be improved upon by considering more realistic models of viral infection..\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA model of HIV-1 pathogenesis that includes an intracellular delay, Patrick W.

The proposed interfering virus, which is designed to superinfect HIV-1 infected cells, carries ribozymes that cleave conserved regions in HIV-1 RNA that code for the viral envelope protein. Thus DIV infection of HIV-1 infected cells should reduce or eliminate viral production by these cells. The success of this therapeutic strategy will depend both on the intercellular interaction of DIV and HIV-1, and on the overall dynamics of virus and T cells in the body. To study these dynamical issues, we have constructed a mathematical model of the interaction of HIV-1, DIV, and CD4+ cells in vivo. The results of both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that survival of the engineered DIV purely on a peripheral blood HIV-1 infection is unlikely. However, analytical results indicate that DIV might well survive on HIV-1 infected CD4+ cells in lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and spleen, or on other HIV-1 infected cells in these organs.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nModeling defective interfering virus therapy for AIDS: conditions for DIV survival, Nelson G, Perelson A, 1995, *Mathematical Biosciences*, 125, 127-153.

The analysis indicates that the major initial effect of IFN is to block virion production or release, with blocking efficacies of 81, 95, and 96% for daily doses of 5, 10, and 15 million international units, respectively. The estimated virion half-life (t1\/2) was, on average, 2.7 hours, with pretreatment production and clearance of 10(12) virions per day. The estimated infected cell death rate exhibited large interpatient variation (corresponding t1\/2 = 1.7 to 70 days), was inversely correlated with baseline viral load, and was positively correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels. Fast death rates were predictive of virus being undetectable by polymerase chain reaction at 3 months. These findings show that infection with hepatitis C virus is highly dynamic and that early monitoring of viral load can help guide therapy. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis C viral dynamics in vivo and the antiviral efficacy of interferon-alpha therapy, Avidan U.

In this study, we develop a model of active contraction to elucidate the relative importance of the [Ca(2+)](i) transient magnitude, the unbinding of Ca(2+) from troponin C (TnC), and the length-dependence of tension and Ca(2+) sensitivity on relaxation. Using the framework proposed by one of our researchers, we extensively reviewed experimental literature, to quantitatively characterize the binding of Ca(2+) to TnC, the kinetics of tropomyosin, the availability of binding sites, and the kinetics of crossbridge binding after perturbations in sarcomere length. Model parameters were determined from multiple experimental results and modalities (skinned and intact preparations) and model results were validated against data from length step, caged Ca(2+), isometric twitches, and the half-time to relaxation with increasing sarcomere length experiments. A factorial analysis found that the [Ca(2+)](i) transient and the unbinding of Ca(2+) from TnC were the primary determinants of relaxation, with a fivefold greater effect than that of length-dependent maximum tension and twice the effect of tension-dependent binding of Ca(2+) to TnC and length-dependent Ca(2+) sensitivity. The affects of the [Ca(2+)](i) transient and the unbinding rate of Ca(2+) from TnC were tightly coupled with the effect of increasing either factor, depending on the reference [Ca(2+)](i) transient and unbinding rate.",

We performed simulations in the presence of stretch-dependent increases in flux through the Na(+)-H(+) exchanger (NHE) and [Formula: see text] exchanger (AE), stretch-activated channels (SAC), and the stretch-dependent nitric oxide (NO) induced increased open probability of the ryanodine receptors to estimate the capacity of each mechanism to produce the slow force response (SFR). Inclusion of stretch-dependent NHE & AE, SACs, and stretch-dependent NO effects caused an increase in tension following 15 min of stretch of 0.87%, 32%, and 0%, respectively. Comparing [Ca(2+)](i) dynamics before and after stretch in the presence of combinations of the three stretch-dependent elements, which produced significant SFR values (>20%), showed that the inclusion of stretch-dependent NO effects produced [Ca(2+)](i) transients, which were not consistent with experimental results. Further simulations showed that in the presence of SACs and the absence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE inhibition of NHE attenuated the SFR, such that reduced SFR in the presence of NHE blockers does not indicate a stretch dependence of NHE. Rather, a functioning NHE is responsible for a portion of the SFR. Based on our simulations we estimate that in rat cardiac myocytes at room temperature SACs play a significant role in producing the SFR, potentially in the presence of stretch-dependent NHE & AE and that NO effects, if any, must involve more mechanisms than just increasing the open probability of ryanodine receptors.",

This model is known to run in COR and OpenCell.\n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nIntroduction: The idea that sodium-calcium exchange might generate a current during cardiac electrical activity was first raised as a possible mechanism for the pathological situation when calcium-overloaded tissue generates the transient inward current responsible for ectopic beating. This was one of the mechanisms proposed by Kass, Lederer, Tsien,\nand Weingart in 1978. Mullins had already suggested on theoretical grounds that a variety of currents flowing across the cardiac cell membrane might be carried by sodium-calcium exchange. With regard to the transient inward current, the evidence that it is carried mostly (though not entirely) by sodium-calcium exchange is now very strong in ventricular cells,4 and it has proved possible to reproduce this mechanism in computer models of cardiac electrical activity. The purpose of the present paper is to review the evidence, experimental and theoretical, for a major role of the sodium-calcium exchange current during normal cardiac rhythm. \n\n\n\n\nBrown et al. and Arlock and Noble recorded slow components of inward current following the calcium current that were attributed to sodium-calcium exchange activated by the intracellular calcium transient, while Mitchell et al. and Schouten and ter Keurs showed that the exchange current could play a major role in maintaining the late low plateau in rat ventricular cells. Several years previously Simurda et al. showed that a component of inward current during weak depolarizations is directly proportional to contractile force, suggesting that it was calcium activated.\n \n\n\n\nUntil 1987 it has to be admitted that these explanations were always subject to the criticism that the currents concerned were measured in highly complex situations with many other current components also present. Of course, if the role of sodium-calcium exchange during normal cellular activity is to be assessed, such experiments are necessary,\nand we will describe more of them later in this paper. But they need to be backed up by experiments done under conditions where the exchange current is isolated from other components. This was first achieved by Kimura, Miyamae, and Noma in 1987. The results were very relevant indeed, not only because they showed the electrogenic\nnature of the sodium-calcium exchange in cardiac cells (including demonstrating that\nits most likely stoichiometry was 3 : 1) but also because the current-voltage relations\nobtained were very similar to those required theoretically in modeling work to explain the results obtained in normal beating cardiac tissue.\n \n\n\n\nIt is no longer necessary, therefore, to prove the hypothesis that sodium-calcium exchange contributes a significant electric current. The question now is rather a functional one: How large can this current be and can it be sufficient to be primarily responsible for maintaining calcium balance in the heart by generating the major\ncomponent of calcium efflux? This is the hypothesis that led to the experimental and\nmodeling work done by Hilgemann and Noble. In this paper, we will describe experiments done on atrial and ventricular cells that attempt to refine this hypothesis. We will raise the question of how the contribution of\nsodium-calcium exchange to the action potential varies with the region of the heart from which the cells come, with the ionic concentration levels (in particular of internal ion concentrations) and with inotropic state.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Sodium-Calcium Exchange During the Cardiac Action Potential, by Noble D, Noble SJ, Bett GC, Earm YE, Ho WK, So IK, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1991;639:334-53.\n [PubMed ID: 1785860](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1785860)",

The calcium in this space is also assumed to play the major role in calcium-induced inactivation of the calcium current. Delayed potassium current equations have been developed to include the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed rectifier current based on the data of of Heath and Terrar, along with data from Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz. Length- and tension-dependent changes in mechanical and electrophysiological processes have been incorporated as described recently by Kohl et al. Drug receptor interactions have started to be developed, using the sodium channel as the first target. The new model has been tested against experimental data on action potential clamp, and on force-interval and duration-interval relations; it has been found to reliably reproduce experimental observations.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nImproved guinea-pig ventricular cell model incorporating a diadic space, IKr and IKs, and length- and tension-dependent processes, Denis Noble, Anthony Varghese, Peter Kohl and Penelope Noble, 1998, *Can J Cardiol*, 14, 123-134.

S and M phases are temporally separated by gaps, G1 and G2 phases. These discrete phases of the cell cycle are carefully regulated by specific proteins, and in most eukaryotic cells, cell cycle events are coordinated at three checkpoints:\n\n\n* In G1 phase, cells analyse both their external environment and their intracellular state before committing to a new cycle of DNA synthesis and division.\n* In the G2 phase, the cell checks that DNA synthesis and repair are complete, and that the cell has reached a critical size before mitosis is initiated.\n* Thirdly, at metaphase, the cell ensures that all chromosomes are correctly aligned on the central plate before they are separated to opposite poles of the spindle.\n\n\n\nOver the past few years advances in molecular genetics have lead to the elucidation of many of the molecular details of these control mechanisms. But although cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are known to trigger the major events of the cell cycle, the precise mechanisms of the checkpoint controls are still uncertain.\n\n\n\n\nConcurrent with advances in experimental techniques and the generation of molecular data, mathematical models of increasing complexity have evolved. In the study described here, Novak *et al.* develop a mathematical model of the fission yeast cell cycle with checkpoint controls at the G1\/S, G2\/M and metaphase\/anaphase transitions (see \n the figure\n below). Much is known about the physiology, genetics and molecular biology of the fission yeast (*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*). By varying the parameter values of their model, the authors were able to represent both wild-type and *wee1-* mutant cells. They found that their model was consistent with the observed phenotypes of many different mutant fission yeast strains, and it also was able to predict interesting phenotypes for some multiple-mutant strains that have not yet been constructed and analysed. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model of the fission yeast cell cycle with checkpoint controls at the G1\/S, G2\/M and metaphase\/anaphase transitions, Bela Novak, Attila Csikasz-Nagy, Bela Gyorffy, Kathy Chen, and John J.

Can these molecular components be spun together into a consistent mechanism that accounts for the observed behavior of growth and division in fission yeast cells? To answer this question, we propose a mechanism for the control system, convert it into a set of 14 differential and algebraic equations, study these equations by numerical simulation and bifurcation theory, and compare our results to the physiology of wild-type and mutant cells. In wild-type cells, progress through the cell cycle (G1-->S-->G2-->M) is related to cyclic progression around a hysteresis loop, driven by cell growth and chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate. However, the control system operates much differently in double-mutant cells, wee1(-) cdc25Delta, which are defective in progress through the latter half of the cell cycle (G2 and M phases). These cells exhibit \"quantized\" cycles (interdivision times clustering around 90, 160, and 230 min). We show that these quantized cycles are associated with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in the mechanism, when the wee1 and cdc25 genes are disabled.

To uncover the full dynamical possibilities of the control system, we translate the regulatory network into a set of differential equations and study these equations by graphical techniques and computer simulation. The positive feedback loops in the model account for thresholds and time lags in cyclin-induced and MPF-induced activation of MPF, and the model can be fitted quantitatively to these experimental observations. The negative feedback loop is consistent with observed time lags in MPF-induced cyclin degradation. Furthermore, our model indicates that there are two possible mechanisms for autonomous oscillations. One is driven by the positive feedback loops, resulting in phosphorylation and abrupt dephosphorylation of the Cdc2 subunit at an inhibitory tyrosine residue. These oscillations are typical of oocyte extracts. The other type is driven by the negative feedback loop, involving rapid cyclin turnover and negligible phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of Cdc2. The early mitotic cycles of intact embryos exhibit such characteristics. In addition, by assuming that unreplicated DNA interferes with M-phase initiation by activating the phosphatases that oppose MPF in the positive feedback loops, we can simulate the effect of addition of sperm nuclei to oocyte extracts, and the lengthening of cycle times at the mid-blastula transition of intact embryos.\n \n\n\n\n The original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n Numerical analysis of a comprehensive model of M-phase control in *Xenopus oocyte* extracts and intact embryos, Bela Novak and John J.

Strict controls normally operate to prevent repeated rounds of DNA replication without intervening mitoses (\"endoreplication\") or initiation of mitosis before DNA is fully replicated (\"mitotic catastrophe\"). Some of the genetic interactions involved in these controls have recently been identified in yeast.

Using established principles of biochemical kinetics, we compare the properties of this model in detail with the observed behavior of various mutant strains of fission yeast: wee1(-) (size control at Start), cdc13Delta and rum1(OP) (endoreplication), and wee1(-) rum1Delta (rapid division cycles of diminishing cell size). We discuss essential features of the mechanism that are responsible for characteristic properties of Start control in fission yeast, to expose our proposal to crucial experimental tests.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling the control of DNA replication in fission yeast, Bela Novak and John J.

The solutions to this model (a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations) are discussed with respect to existing experiments. Predictions based on mathematical analysis of this model are presented. In particular, results are presented on the existence of two stablesolutions, i.e., bistability within the G1-phase. It is shown that this bistability exists under unsaturated growth factor concentration levels. This phenomenon is very noticeable if the efficiency of the signal transduction, initiated by the growth factors leading to cyclin D synthesis, is low.

These intermediates inactivate many types of biomolecules, including peroxidase itself. Previously, we have shown that oscillatory dynamics in the peroxidase-oxidase reaction seem to protect the enzyme from inactivation. It was suggested that this is due to a lower average concentration of reactive oxygen species in the oscillatory state compared to the steady state. Here, we studied the peroxidase-oxidase reaction with either 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or melatonin as cofactors. We show that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is present in both cases. We also found that the enzyme degradation depends on the concentration of the cofactor and on the pH of the reaction mixture. We simulated the oscillatory behaviour, including the oscillation\/steady state bistability observed experimentally, using a detailed reaction scheme. The computational results confirm the hypothesis that protection is due to lower average concentrations of superoxide radical during oscillations. They also show that the shape of the oscillations changes with increasing cofactor concentration resulting in a further decrease in the average concentration of radicals. We therefore hypothesize that the protective effect of oscillatory dynamics is a general effect in this system.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Mechanism of protection of peroxidase activity by oscillatory dynamics, Lars F.

Despite intensive research in intracellular calcium signalling it is an unsolved riddle how the different types of information represented by the different agonists, is encoded using the universal carrier calcium.

After the discovery of calcium oscillations, one likely mechanism is that information is encoded in the frequency, amplitude and waveform of the oscillations. This hypothesis has received some experimental support. However, the mechanism of decoding of oscillatory signals is still not known. Here, we study a mechanistic model of calcium oscillations, which is able to reproduce both spiking and bursting calcium oscillations. We use the model to study the decoding of calcium signals on the basis of co-operativity of calcium binding to various proteins. We show that this co-operativity offers a simple way to decode different calcium dynamics into different enzyme activities.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nOn the encoding and decoding of calcium signals in hepatocytes, Ann Zahle Larsen, Lars Folke Olsen, Ursula Kummer, 2004 *Biophysical Chemistry*, 107, 83-89.

Here we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na\/K\/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such.

        "abstract":"Our mathematical model of the rat ventricular myocyte (Pandit et al., 2001) was utilized to explore the ionic mechanism(s) that underlie the altered electrophysiological characteristics associated with the short-term model of streptozotocin-induced, type-I diabetes. The simulations show that the observed reductions in the Ca(2+)-independent transient outward K(+) current (I(t)) and the steady-state outward K(+) current (I(ss)), along with slowed inactivation of the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)), can result in the prolongation of the action potential duration, a well-known experimental finding. In addition, the model demonstrates that the slowed reactivation kinetics of I(t) in diabetic myocytes can account for the more pronounced rate-dependent action potential duration prolongation in diabetes, and that a decrease in the electrogenic Na(+)-K(+) pump current (I(NaK)) results in a small depolarization in the resting membrane potential (V(rest)). This depolarization reduces the availability of the Na(+) channels (I(Na)), thereby resulting in a slower upstroke (dV\/dt(max)) of the diabetic action potential. Additional simulations suggest that a reduction in the magnitude of I(CaL), in combination with impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake can lead to a decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load. These factors contribute to characteristic abnormal [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis (reduced peak systolic value and rate of decay) in myocytes from diabetic animals. In combination, these simulation results provide novel information and integrative insights concerning plausible ionic mechanisms for the observed changes in cardiac repolarization and excitation-contraction coupling in rat ventricular myocytes in the setting of streptozotocin-induced, type-I diabetes.",

(1992) J. Membrane Biol. 125:49-62) were evaluated in terms of a kinetic model. The steady-state and presteady-state cotransporter properties are described by a 6-state ordered kinetic model (\"mirror\" symmetry) with a Na:aMDG stoichiometry of 2. Carrier translocation in the membrane as well as Na and sugar binding and dissociation are treated as a function of their individual rate constants. Empty carrier translocation and Na binding\/dissociation are the only steps considered to be voltage dependent. Currents were associated with the translocation of the negatively charged carrier in the membrane. Negative membrane potential facilitates sugar transport. One numerical solution was found for the 14 rate constants that account quantitatively for our experiment observations: i.e., (i) sigmoidal shape of the sugar-specific current-voltage curves (absence of outward currents and inward current saturation at high negative potentials), (ii) Na and voltage dependence of K\\_0.5\\_sugar and i\\_max\\_sugar , (iii) sugar and voltage dependence of K\\_0.5\\_Na and i\\_max\\_Na, (iv) presteady-state currents and their dependence on external Na, aMDG and membrane potential, and (v) and carrier Na leak current. We conclude that the main voltage effect is on carrier translocation. Na ions that migrate from the extracellular medium to their binding sites sense 25 to 35% of the transmembrane voltage, whereas charges associated with the carrier translocation experiences 60 to 75% of the membrane electrical field. Internal Na ion binding is not voltage dependent. In our nonrapid equilibrium model, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is a function of the membrane potential, [Na]o and [aMDG]o. At 0 mV and at saturating [Na]o and [aMDG]o, the rate-limiting step for sugar transport is the empty carrier translocation (5 sec-1). As the membrane potential is made more negative, the empty carrier translocation gets faster and the internal Na dissociation becomes increasingly rate limiting. However, as [Na]o is decreased to less than 10 mM, the ratelimiting step is the external Na ions binding in the 0 to -150 mV potential range. At 0 mV, the external Na dissociation constant KNa' is 80 mM and decreases to 24 mM at -150 mV. The external sugar dissociation constant KNaS' is estimated to be 200 microM and voltage independent. Finally, the internal leak pathway (CNa2 translocation) is insignificant. While we cannot rule out a more complex kinetic model, the electrical properties of the cloned Na\/glucose cotransporter are found to be adequately described by this 6-state kinetic model.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n Electrogenic Properties of the Cloned Na+\/Glucose Cotransporter: II.

To observe an overall oscillatory insulin profile it is necessary that the insulin secretion from individual \u03b2-cells is synchronized within islets, and that the population of islets is also synchronized. We have recently developed a model in which pulsatile insulin secretion is produced as a result of calcium-driven electrical oscillations in combination with oscillations in glycolysis. We use this model to investigate possible mechanisms for intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization. We show that electrical coupling is sufficient to synchronize both electrical bursting activity and metabolic oscillations. We also demonstrate that islets can synchronize by mutually entraining each other by their effects on a simple model \u201cliver,\u201d which responds to the level of insulin secretion by adjusting the blood glucose concentration in an appropriate way. Since all islets are exposed to the blood, the distributed islet-liver system can synchronize the individual islet insulin oscillations. Thus, we demonstrate how intra-islet and inter-islet synchronization of insulin oscillations may be achieved.",

Using this model we show that many of the puzzling quantitative features of HIV infection can be explained simply. We also consider effects of AZT on viral growth and T-cell population dynamics. The model exhibits two steady states, an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected state, in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if N, the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T cell, is less a critical value, Ncrit, then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative orthant, and this state is stable. For N > Ncrit, the uninfected state is unstable, and the endemically infected state can be either stable, or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is stable, it is characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment of this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T cells, during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows exponentially, and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation the model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in the model. The model predicts that different viral strains, characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T cells, can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate depletion at different rates. Two versions of the model are studied. In one the source of T cells from precursors is constant, whereas in the other the source of T cells decreases with viral load, mimicking the infection and killing of T-cell precursors. The latter gives more realistic predictions than the model with a constant source.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nDynamics of HIV infection of CD4+ T cells, Perelson, Kirschner, Boer, *Mathematical Biosciences*, 114, 81-125.

The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days.

As discovered in the mid 90s, the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling cascade is a major signaling pathway regulating bone remodeling. In this paper we study theoretically the functional implications of particular RANKL\/OPG expression profiles on bone volume. For this purpose we formulate an extended bone-cell dynamics model describing functional behaviour of basic multicellular units (BMUs) responsible for bone resorption and formation. This model incorporates the RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling together with the regulating action of TGF-beta on bone cells. The bone-cell population model employed here builds on the work of Lemaire et al. (2004) [1], but incorporates the following significant modifications: (i) addition of a rate equation describing changes in bone volume with time as the key 'output function' tracking functional behaviour of BMUs, (ii) a rate equation describing release of TGF-beta from the bone matrix, (iii) expression of OPG and RANKL on both osteoblastic cell lines, and (iv) modified activator\/repressor functions. Using bone volume as a functional selection criterion, we find that there is a preferred arrangement for ligand expression on particular cell types, and further, that this arrangement coincides with biological observations. We then investigate the model parameter space combinatorially, searching for preferred 'groupings' of changes in differentiation rates of various cell types. Again, a criterion of bone volume change is employed to identify possible ways of optimally controlling BMU responses. While some combinations of changes in differentiation rates are clearly unrealistic, other combinations of changes in differentiation rates are potentially functionally significant. Most importantly, the combination of parameter changes representing the signaling pathway for TGF-beta gives a unique result that appears to have a clear biological rationale. The methodological approach for the investigation of model structure described here offers a theoretical explanation as to why TGF-beta has its particular suite of biological effects on bone-cell differentiation rates.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModel structure and control of bone remodeling: a theoretical study, Pivonka P, Zimak J, Smith DW, Gardiner BS, Dunstan CR, Sims NA, Martin TJ, Mundy GR, 2008, *Bone*, 43, 249-263.

The PTH1R is a major target for new osteoporosis treatments, as pulsatile PTH dosing has been shown to induce net bone formation in both animals and humans, and PTH(1-34) was recently FDA approved for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. PTH has also been shown to cause net bone loss when given continuously, so that the net action of PTH on bone is dependent on the dosing pattern. We have developed a simplified two-state receptor kinetics model for the PTH1R, based on the concepts of Segel et al., to distinguish the activity of active and inactive receptor and receptor-ligand complexes. The goal is to develop a plausible model of the minimal essential biological relationships necessary for understanding the responses to PTH dosing. A two-state model is able to effectively discriminate between continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing using the active species as surrogates for the downstream anabolic response. For continuous PTH dosing, the model predicts a desensitized system dominated by the inactive receptor and complex, consistent with downstream net bone loss that has been demonstrated experimentally. Using pulsatile PTH dosing, the model system predicts a highly sensitized state dominated by the active receptor and complex, corresponding to net bone formation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the kinetics of the receptor plays a critical role in the downstream effects of PTH dosing. Moreover, these results indicate that within a range of biologically relevant PTH doses, the two-state model is able to capture the differential behavior of the system for both continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing. The development of such a model provides a rational basis for developing more biologically extensive models that may support the design of optimal dosing strategies for PTH-based anti-osteoporosis treatments. Moreover, this model provides a unique starting point from which to design experiments investigating PTH receptor biology.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nResponse to continuous and pulsatile PTH dosing: a mathematical model for parathyroid hormone receptor kinetics, Laura K.

Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is important for assessing the reproductive effects of environmental and pharmaceutical androgenic and antiandrogenic compounds. A mathematical model for the dynamics of androgenic synthesis, transport, metabolism, and regulation of the adult rodent ventral prostate was developed on the basis of a model by Barton and Anderson (1997). The model describes the systemic and local kinetics of testosterone (T), 5{alpha}-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and luteinizing hormone (LH), with metabolism of T to DHT by 5{alpha}-reductase in liver and prostate. Also included are feedback loops for the positive regulation of T synthesis by LH and negative regulation of LH by T and DHT. The model simulates maintenance of the prostate as a function of hormone concentrations and androgen receptor (AR)-mediated signal transduction. The regulatory processes involved in prostate size and function include cell proliferation, apoptosis, fluid production, and 5{alpha}-reductase activity. Each process is controlled through the occupancy of a representative gene by androgen-AR dimers. The model simulates prostate dynamics for intact, castrated, and intravenous T-injected rats. After calibration, the model accurately captures the castration-induced regression of the prostate compared with experimental data that show that the prostate regresses to ~17 and 5% of its intact weight at 14 and 30 days postcastration, respectively. The model also accurately predicts serum T and AR levels following castration compared with data. This model provides a framework for quantifying the kinetics and effects of environmental and pharmaceutical endocrine active compounds on the prostate.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model for the androgenic regulation of the prostate in intact and castrated adult male rats, Laura K.

Alterations of the electric properties of single myocytes in heart failure may favor the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients by inducing early or delayed afterdepolarizations. Mathematical models of the cellular action potential and its underlying ionic currents could help to elucidate possible arrhythmogenic mechanisms on a cellular level. In the present study, selected ionic currents based on human data are incorporated into a model of the ventricular action potential for the purpose of studying the cellular electrophysiological consequences of heart failure. Ionic currents that are not yet sufficiently characterized in human ventricular myocytes are adopted from the action potential model developed by Luo and Rudy (LR model). The main results obtained from this model are as follows: The action potential in ventricular myocytes from failing hearts is longer than in nonfailing control hearts. The major underlying mechanisms for this prolongation are the enhanced activity of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, the slowed diastolic decay of the [Ca2+]i transient, and the reduction of the inwardly rectifying K+ current and the Na+-K+ pump current in myocytes of failing hearts. Furthermore, the fast and slow components of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Kr) and I(Ks), respectively) are of utmost importance in determining repolarization of the human ventricular action potential. In contrast, the influence of the transient outward K+ current on APD is only small in both cell groups. Inhibition of I(Kr) promotes the development of early afterdepolarizations in failing, but not nonfailing, myocytes. Furthermore, spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers a premature action potential only in failing myocytes. This model of the ventricular action potential and its alterations in heart failure is intended to serve as a tool for investigating the effects of therapeutic interventions on the electric excitability of the human ventricular myocardium.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nSimulation study of cellular electric properties in heart failure, Leo Priebe and Dirk J.

The units have been checked and are consistent. This CellML description is deterministic, unlike the stochastic model created and preferred by the authors. A few equations are therefore different from the model in the Biomodels database, such as the rate equations describing the dimerisation of HSF1 and the aggregation of MisP, and the graphs produced have smooth curves since random fluctuations of the intracellular preocesses are not taken into account. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nABSTRACT: Many molecular chaperones are also known as heat shock proteins because they are synthesised in increased amounts after brief exposure\nof cells to elevated temperatures. They have many cellular functions and are involved in the folding of nascent proteins, the re-folding of\ndenatured proteins, the prevention of protein aggregation, and assisting the targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome and\nlysosomes. They also have a role in apoptosis and are involved in modulating signals for immune and inflammatory responses. Stress-induced\ntranscription of heat shock proteins requires the activation of heat shock factor (HSF). Under normal conditions, HSF is bound to heat shock\nproteins resulting in feedback repression. During stress, cellular proteins undergo denaturation and sequester heat shock proteins bound to\nHSF, which is then able to become transcriptionally active.\n\n\n\n\n The induction of heat shock proteins is impaired with age and there is also a decline in chaperone function. Aberrant\/damaged proteins\naccumulate with age and are implicated in several important age-related conditions (e.g. Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and\ncataract). Therefore, the balance between damaged proteins and available free chaperones may be greatly disturbed during ageing.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for homeostatic degradation of intact protein substrates as well as the elimination of damaged or misfolded proteins that might otherwise aggregate. During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML). Simulations are carried out on the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation) system and the model output is compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under various conditions. The model can be used to predict the effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation. RESULTS: The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different conditions. However, our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under conditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics. CONCLUSION: We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. Using SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process.",

The model also reproduces the repetitive firing properties seen in neonatal HMs and replicates the neuron's response to pharmacological experiments. The model was used to study the role of specific ionic currents in HM firing and how variations in the densities of these currents may account for age-dependent changes in excitability seen in HMs. By varying the density of a fast inactivating calcium current, the model alternates between accelerating and adapting firing patterns. Modeling the age-dependent increase in H current density accounts for the decrease in mAHP duration observed experimentally, but does not fully account for the decrease in input resistance. An increase in the density of the voltage-dependent potassium currents and the H current is required to account for the decrease in input resistance. These changes also account for the age-dependent decrease in action potential duration.\n\n\n\n \nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIonic current model of a hypoglossal motoneuron, Robert J.

Although the existence of neurons with pacemaker-like bursting properties in this network is not questioned, their role in network rhythmogenesis is unresolved. Modeling is ideally suited to address this debate because of the ease with which biophysical parameters of individual cells and network architecture can be manipulated. We modeled the parameter variability of experimental data from pBC bursting pacemaker and nonpacemaker neurons using a modified version of our previously developed pBC neuron and network models. To investigate the role of pacemakers in networkwide rhythmogenesis, we simulated networks of these neurons and varied the fraction of the population made up of pacemakers. For each number of pacemaker neurons, we varied the amount of tonic drive to the network and measured the frequency of synchronous networkwide bursting produced. Both excitatory networks with all-to-all coupling and sparsely connected networks were explored for several levels of synaptic coupling strength. Networks containing only nonpacemakers were able to produce networkwide bursting, but with a low probability of bursting and low input and output ranges. The results indicate that inclusion of pacemakers in an excitatory network increases robustness of the network by more than tripling the input and output ranges compared with networks containing no pacemakers. The largest increase in dynamic range occurs when the number of pacemakers in the network is greater than 20% of the population. Experimental tests of the model predictions are proposed.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nIntrinsic Bursters Increase the Robustness of Rythm Generation in an Excitatory Network, L.K.

Among these processes, metabolic alterations seem to play an important role. RESULTS: We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, altering the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasmic NADP(H) pool. Remarkably, another key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is known to be inactivated in response to various oxidant treatments, and we show that this provokes a similar redirection of the metabolic flux. CONCLUSION: The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative stress. As a consequence, altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells under stress conditions.",

To obtain insights into the ionic mechanisms governing canine atrial AP properties, we incorporated formulations of K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), and Cl(-) currents, based on measurements in canine atrial myocytes, into a mathematical model of the AP. The rate-dependent behavior of model APs corresponded to experimental measurements and pointed to a central role for L-type Ca(2+) current inactivation in rate adaptation. Incorporating previously described regional ionic current variations into the model largely reproduced AP forms characteristic of the corresponding right atrial regions (appendage, pectinate muscle, crista terminalis, and atrioventricular ring). When ionic alterations induced by tachycardia-dependent remodeling were incorporated, the model reproduced qualitatively the AP features constituting the cellular substrate for atrial fibrillation.

These pathways play a crucial role in deciding cell fate in response to inflammation and infection. Our model incorporates known specific protein-protein interactions as identified by experiments. Using these biochemical interactions, we develop a mathematical model of the NF-kappaB-mediated survival and caspase-mediated apoptosis pathways. Using mass action kinetics, we follow the formation of the survival and late complexes as well as the dynamics of DNA fragmentation. The effect of TNF-alpha concentration on DNA fragmentation is modeled and compares well with experiment. Nuclear transcription is also modeled phenomenologically by means of time lagged cytosolic concentrations. This results in transcription related concentrations undergoing under-damped oscillations, in qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment. Using a tumor cell as a hypothetical model, we explore the interplay between the components of the survival and apoptotic pathways. Results are presented which make predictions on the limits of cellular oscillations in terms of time delay, initial concentration ratios and other features of the model. The model also makes clear predictions on cell viability in terms of DNA damage within the framework of TNF-alpha stimulus duration.\n\n\nThe original paper is cited below:\n\n\n\n Survival and Apoptotic Pathways Initiated by TNF-alpha: Modeling and Predictions.

Other factors can be added as the need arises. The model is aimed at simulating what happens in a single individual, but its parameters and variables were adjusted to the corresponding published average values. Simulations of published observations in humans undergoing the infusion of calcium or its chelators are presented. With a single exception, these simulations provided a good fit to the data. The response of the system to extrinsic perturbations was characterized by simulating chronic infusions of calcium, PTH, and calcitriol. Finally, the steady state response to perturbations in some of its parameters (the secretory mass of the parathyroids and the affinity and\/or sensitivity of the calcium, PTH, and calcitriol receptors) and to renal failure were also investigated in an attempt to analyze the pathogenesis of clinical hypo- or hypercalcemias. In its present form the model cannot be used to base clinical decisions in individual cases. However, it requires modest computational resources, and clinicians with a modest mathematical background can manipulate it. It is a useful tool for the analysis of general mechanisms of the diseases of calcium metabolism and for the design of clinical experiments aimed at characterizing these diseases.

Several aspects of its growth, turnover, and mechanism, occur in the absence of gonadal hormones. Sex steroids such as estrogen, nonetheless, play an important role in bone physiology, and are extremely essential to maintain bone balance in adults. In order to provide a basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of bone remodeling as it is mediated by PTH, we propose here a mathematical model of the process. The nonlinear system model is then utilized to study the temporal effect of PTH as well as the action of estrogen replacement therapy on bone turnover. Analysis of the model is done on the assumption, supported by reported clinical evidence, that the process is characterized by highly diversified dynamics, which warrants the use of singular perturbation arguments. The model is shown to exhibit limit cycle behavior, which can develop into chaotic dynamics for certain ranges of the system's parametric values. Effects of estrogen and PTH administrations are then investigated by extending on the core model. Analysis of the model seems to indicate that the paradoxical observation that intermittent PTH administration causes net bone deposition while continuous administration causes net bone loss, and certain other reported phenomena may be attributed to the highly diversified dynamics which characterizes this nonlinear remodeling process. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModeling of bone formation and resorption mediated by parathyroid hormone: response to estrogen\/PTH therapy, Chontita Rattanakul, Yongwimon Lenbury, Nateetip Krishnamara, and David J.

        "abstract":"Cooperativity in contractile behavior of myofilament systems almost assuredly arises because of interactions between neighboring sites. These interactions may be of different kinds. Tropomyosin thin-filament regulatory units may have neighbors in steric blocking positions (off) or steric permissive positions (on). The position of these neighbors influence the tendency for the regulatory unit to assume the on or off state. Likewise, the tendency of a myosin cross-bridge to achieve a force-bearing state may be influenced by whether neighboring cross-bridges are in force-bearing states. Also, a cross-bridge in the force-bearing state may influence the tendency of a regulatory unit to enter the on state. We used a mathematical model to examine the influence of each of these three kinds of neighbor interactions on the steady-state force-pCa relation and on the dynamic force redevelopment process. Each neighbor interaction was unique in its effects on maximal Ca(2+)-activated force, position, and symmetry of the force-pCa curve and on the Hill coefficient. Also, each neighbor interaction had a distinctive effect on the time course of force development as assessed by its rate coefficient, k(dev). These diverse effects suggest that variations in all three kinds of nearest-neighbor interactions may be responsible for a wide variety of currently unexplained observations of myofilament contractile behavior.",

(2000), a mathematical model is developed for the methionine cycle. A large amount of information is available about the enzymes that catalyse individual reaction steps in the cycle, from methionine to S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine, and the removal of mass from the cycle by the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. Nevertheless, the behavior of the cycle is very complicated since many substrates alter the activities of the enzymes in the reactions that produce them, and some can also alter the activities of other enzymes in the cycle. The model consists of four differential equations, based on known reaction kinetics, that can be solved to give the time course of the concentrations of the four main substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show that the behavior of the model in response to genetic abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies. We conduct computational \"experiments\" that give understanding of the regulatory behavior of the methionine cycle under normal conditions and the behavior in the presence of genetic variation and dietary deficiencies.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n A mathematical model of the methionine cycle, Michael C.

The control of the infection is an indirect effect of the selective elimination by an engineered virus of infected cells that are the source of the pathogens. Therefore, this engineered virus could greatly compensate for a dysfunctional immune system compromised by AIDS. In vitro studies using engineered viruses have been shown to decrease the HIV-1 load about 1000-fold. However, the efficacy of this potential treatment for reducing the viral load in AIDS patients is unknown. The present model studied the interactions among the HIV-1 virus, its main host cell (activated CD4+ T cells), and a therapeutic engineered virus in an in vivo context; and it examined the conditions for controlling the pathogen. This model predicted a significant drop in the HIV-1 load, but the treatment does not eradicate HIV. A basic estimation using a currently engineered virus indicated an HIV-1 load reduction of 92% and a recovery of host cells to 17% of their normal level. Greater success (98% HIV reduction, 44% host cells recovery) is expected as more competent engineered viruses are designed. These results suggest that therapy using viruses could be an alternative to extend the survival of AIDS patients.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nFighting a virus with a virus: a dynamic model for HIV-1 therapy, Tomas Revilla and Gisela Garcia-Ramos, 2003, *Mathematical Biosciences*, 185, 191-203.

Complex MF behaviors are difficult to model because spatial interactions cannot be directly implemented as ordinary differential equations. We therefore allow phenomenological approximations with careful consideration to the relationships with the underlying biophysical mechanisms. We describe new formulations that avoid mean-field approximations found in most existing MF models. To increase the scope and applicability of the model, we include length- and temperature-dependent effects that play important roles in MF responses. We have also included a representation of passive restoring forces to simulate isolated cell shortening protocols. Possessing both computational efficiency and the ability to simulate a wide variety of muscle responses, the MF representation is well suited for coupling to existing cardiac cell models of electrophysiology and Ca-handling mechanisms. To illustrate this suitability, the MF model is coupled to the Chicago rabbit cardiomyocyte model. The combined model generates realistic appearing action potentials, intracellular Ca transients, and cell shortening signals. The combined model also demonstrates that the feedback effects of force on Ca binding to troponin can modify the cytosolic Ca transient.",

The ordered progression between these phases is achieved thanks to the existence of checkpoint mechanisms based on mutual inhibition of these processes. Here we study a simple theoretical model for oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2 activity, involving mutual inhibition of the two oscillators. Each minimal oscillator is described by a three-variable cascade involving a cdk, together with the associated cyclin and cyclin-degrading enzyme. The dynamics of this skeleton model of coupled oscillators is determined as a function of the strength of their mutual inhibition. The most common mode of dynamic behavior, obtained under conditions of strong mutual inhibition, is that of alternating oscillations in cdk1 and cdk2, which correspond to the physiological situation of the ordered recurrence of the M and S phases. In addition, for weaker inhibition we obtain evidence for a variety of dynamic phenomena such as complex periodic oscillations, chaos, and the coexistence between multiple periodic or chaotic attractors. We discuss the conditions of occurrence of these various modes of oscillatory behavior, as well as their possible physiological significance.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\nAlternating Oscillations and Chaos in a Model of Two Coupled Biochemical Oscillators Driving Successive Phases of the Cell Cycle, Pierre-Charles Romond, Mauro Rustici, Didier Gonze, Albert GOldbeter, 1999, *Annals of the New York Acedemy of Sciences*, 879, 180-193.

        "abstract":"Although potent combination therapy is usually able to suppress plasma viral loads in HIV-1 patients to below the detection limit of conventional clinical assays, a low level of viremia frequently can be detected in plasma by more sensitive assays. Additionally, many patients experience transient episodes of viremia above the detection limit, termed viral blips, even after being on highly suppressive therapy for many years. An obstacle to viral eradication is the persistence of a latent reservoir for HIV-1 in resting memory CD4(+) T cells. The mechanisms underlying low viral load persistence, slow decay of the latent reservoir, and intermittent viral blips are not fully characterized. The quantitative contributions of residual viral replication to viral and the latent reservoir persistence remain unclear. In this paper, we probe these issues by developing a mathematical model that considers latently infected cell activation in response to stochastic antigenic stimulation. We demonstrate that programmed expansion and contraction of latently infected cells upon immune activation can generate both low-level persistent viremia and intermittent viral blips. Also, a small fraction of activated T cells revert to latency, providing a potential to replenish the latent reservoir. By this means, occasional activation of latently infected cells can explain the variable decay characteristics of the latent reservoir observed in different clinical studies. Finally, we propose a phenomenological model that includes a logistic term representing homeostatic proliferation of latently infected cells. The model is simple but can robustly generate the multiphasic viral decline seen after initiation of therapy, as well as low-level persistent viremia and intermittent HIV-1 blips. Using these models, we provide a quantitative and integrated prospective into the long-term dynamics of HIV-1 and the latent reservoir in the setting of potent antiretroviral therapy.",

Stimulation of airway myocytes results in an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the subsequent activation of the contractile apparatus. Many contractile agonists, including acetylcholine, induce [Ca2+]i increase via Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through InsP3 receptors. Several models have been developed to explain the characteristics of InsP3-induced [Ca2+]i responses, in particular Ca2+ oscillations. The article reviews the modelling of the major structures implicated in intracellular Ca2+ handling, i.e., InsP3 receptors, SERCAs, mitochondria and Ca2+-binding cytosolic proteins. We developed theoretical models speci\ufb01cally dedicated to the airway myocyte which include the major mechanisms responsible for intracellular Ca2+ handling identi\ufb01ed in these cells. These biocomputations pointed out the importance of the relative proportion of InsP3 receptor isoforms and the respective role of the different mechanisms responsible for cytosolic Ca2+ clearance in the pattern of [Ca2+]i variations. We have developed a theoretical model of membrane conductances that predicts the variations in membrane potential and extracellular Ca2+ in\ufb02ux. Stimulation of this model by simulated increase in [Ca2+]i predicts membrane depolarisation, but not great enough to trigger a signi\ufb01cant opening of voltage-dependant Ca2+ channels. This may explain why airway contraction induced by cholinergic stimulation does not greatly depend on extracellular calcium. The development of such models of airway myocytes is important for the understanding of the cellular mechanisms of airway reactivity and their possible modulation by pharmacological agents.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Modelling of calcium handling in airway myocytes](http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TBN-4GBWFDJ-2&_user=140507&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=fb58937e9ac3f82ee7e81e9b28c139de), Etienne Roux, Penelope J.

Specifically, with removal of the pons, the normal three-phase pattern transformed to a two-phase inspiratory\u2013expiratory pattern and, with more caudal transections, to one-phase, intrinsically generated inspiratory oscillations. A minimal neural network proposed to reproduce these transformations includes 1) a ringlike mutually inhibitory network composed of the postinspiratory, augmenting expiratory, and early-inspiratory neurons and 2) an excitatory preinspiratory neuron, with persistent sodium current (I(NaP))-dependent intrinsic bursting properties, that dynamically participates in the expiratory\u2013inspiratory phase transition and inspiratory phase generation. We used activity-based single-neuron models and applied numerical simulations, bifurcation methods, and fast\u2013slow decomposition to describe the behavior of this network in the functional states corresponding to the three-, two-, and one-phase oscillatory regimes, as well as to analyze the transitions between states and between respiratory phases within each state. We demonstrate that, although I(NaP) is not necessary for the generation of three- and two-phase oscillations, it contributes to control of the oscillation period in each state. We also show that the transitions between states can be produced by progressive changes of drives to particular neurons and proceed through intermediate regimes, featuring high-amplitude late-expiratory and biphasic-expiratory activities or ectopic burst generation. Our results provide important insights for understanding the state-dependent mechanisms for respiratory rhythm generation and control.",

We find that the gating of RyR channels spontaneously shifts between high (H) and low (L) levels of activity and inactive periods where no channel openings are detected (I). Moreover, we find that there is evidence for multiple gating modes within H activity, which we term H1 and H2 mode. Our results demonstrate that the underlying mechanisms regulating gating are similar in native and purified channels. Dwell-time distributions of L activity were best fitted by three open and five closed significant exponential components whereas dwell-time distributions of H1 activity were best fitted by two to three open and four closed significant exponential components. Increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] cause an increase in open probability (Po) within L activity and an increase in the probability of occurrence of H activity. Open lifetime distributions within L activity were Ca2+ independent whereas open lifetime distributions within H activity were Ca2+ dependent. This study is the first attempt to estimate RyR single-channel kinetic parameters from sequences of idealized dwell-times and to develop kinetic models of RyR gating using the criterion of maximum likelihood. We propose distinct kinetic schemes for L, H1, and H2 activity that describe the major features of sheep cardiac RyR channel gating at these levels of activity.",

The model successfully reconstructs the experimental action potentials at various concentrations of external Ca2+ and K+. Increasing the amplitude of L-type Ca2+ current (I(CaL)) prolongs the duration of the action potential and thereby slightly decreases the spontaneous rate. On the other hand, a negative voltage shift of I(CaL) gating by a few mV markedly increases the spontaneous rate. When the amplitude of sustained inward current (I(st)) is increased, the spontaneous rate is increased irrespective of the I(CaL) amplitude. Increasing [Ca2+](o) shortens the action potential and increases the spontaneous rate. When the spontaneous activity is stopped by decreasing I(CaL) amplitude, the resting potential is nearly constant (-35 mV) over 1-15 mM [K+](o) as observed in the experiment. This is because the conductance of the inward background non-selective cation current balances with the outward [K+](o)-dependent K+ conductance. The unique role of individual voltage- and time-dependent ion channels is clearly demonstrated and distinguished from that of the background current by calculating an instantaneous zero current potential (\"lead potential\") during the course of the spontaneous activity. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nRole of Individual Ionic Current Systems in the SA Node Hypothesized by a Model Study, Sarai N, Matsuoka S, Kuratomi S, Ono K, and Noma A, 2003, *The Japanese Journal of Physiology*, 53, 125-134.

We used systems analysis to investigate how the components and topology of this signaling network permit neurohormonal control of excitation-contraction coupling in the rat ventricular myocyte. A kinetic model integrating beta-adrenergic signaling with excitation-contraction coupling was formulated, and each subsystem was validated with independent biochemical and physiological measurements. Model analysis was used to investigate quantitatively the effects of specific molecular perturbations. 3-Fold overexpression of adenylyl cyclase in the model allowed an 85% higher rate of cyclic AMP synthesis than an equivalent overexpression of beta 1-adrenergic receptor, and manipulating the affinity of Gs alpha for adenylyl cyclase was a more potent regulator of cyclic AMP production. The model predicted that less than 40% of adenylyl cyclase molecules may be stimulated under maximal receptor activation, and an experimental protocol is suggested for validating this prediction. The model also predicted that the endogenous heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor may enhance basal cyclic AMP buffering by 68% and increasing the apparent Hill coefficient of protein kinase A activation from 1.0 to 2.0. Finally, phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel and phospholamban were found sufficient to predict the dominant changes in myocyte contractility, including a 2.6x increase in systolic calcium (inotropy) and a 28% decrease in calcium half-relaxation time (lusitropy). By performing systems analysis, the consequences of molecular perturbations in the beta-adrenergic signaling network may be understood within the context of integrative cellular physiology.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nModeling beta-adrenergic control of cardiac myocyte contractility *in silico*\n , Jeffrey J.

The endocrine system is largely self-regulating, compensating for moderate changes in dietary phytoestrogens (e.g., in soy products) and normal variations in physiology. However, severe changes in dietary or oral exposures or in health status (e.g., anorexia) , can completely disrupt the menstrual cycle in women. Thus, risk assessment tools should account for normal regulation and its limits. We present a mathematical model for the synthesis and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women as a function of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin blood levels. The model reproduces the time courses of LH and FSH during the menstrual cycle and correctly predicts observed effects of administered estrogen and progesterone on LH and FSH during clinical studies. The model should be useful for predicting effects of hormonally active substances, both in the pharmaceutical sciences and in toxicology and risk assessment.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA model of gonadotropin regulation during the menstrual cycle in women: qualitative features Paul M.

Although a variation of myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity with sarcomere length (SL) change was found to be involved, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully clarified. Some recent experimental studies indicate that a reduction of the lattice spacing between thin and thick filaments, through the increase of passive tension caused by the sarcomeric protein titin with an increase in SL within the physiological range, promotes formation of force-generating crossbridges (Xbs). However, the mechanism by which the Xb concentration determines the degree of cooperativity for a given SL has so far evaded experimental elucidation. In this simulation study, a novel, rather simple molecular-based cardiac contraction model, appropriate for integration into a ventricular cell model, was designed, being the first model to introduce experimental data on titin-based radial tension to account for the SL-dependent modulation of the interfilament lattice spacing and to include a conformational change of troponin I (TnI). Simulation results for the isometric twitch contraction time course, the length-tension and the force-[Ca(2+)] relationships are comparable to experimental data. A complete potential Frank-Starling mechanism was analyzed by this simulation study. The SL-dependent modulation of the myosin binding rate through titin's passive tension determines the Xb concentration which then alters the degree of positive cooperativity affecting the rate of the TnI conformation change and causing the Hill coefficient to be SL-dependent.\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMechanism of the Frank-Starling law-- A simulation study with a novel cardiac muscle contraction model that includes titin and tropomyosin, Natalie S.

The model reproduces the experimental data available, and predicts certain quantities which would be hard to obtain experimentally, like the individual K+ channel currents when the membrane potential is allowed to freely evolve, the implication of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), and the total K+ released during stimulation. The main results are: (1) the large-conductance K+ channel participates only very little in the overall response; (2) EETs are required in order to explain the experimental current-potential relationships, but are not an essential component of the bradykinin response; and (3) the total K+ released during stimulation gives rise to a concentration in the intercellular space which is of millimolar order.

A system of differential equations is defined by the structure of the model. Rate constants and model parameters are constrained by published experimental data. Model simulations of insulin dose-response experiments agree with published experimental data and also generate expected qualitative behaviors such as sequential signal amplification and increased sensitivity of downstream components. We examined the consequences of incorporating feedback pathways as well as representing pathological conditions, such as increased levels of protein tyrosine phosphatases, to illustrate the utility of our model for exploring molecular mechanisms.

The data describe normal electrical activity and Ca handling characteristics of the cardiac myocyte and the SR Ca load dependence of these processes. The model includes a realistic balance of Ca removal mechanisms (e.g., SR Ca pump versus Na-Ca exchange), and the phenomena of rest decay and frequency-dependent inotropy.

A stable minimal model of the human cardiovascular system (CVS) is developed with the ultimate specific aim of assisting medical staff for rapid, on site modelling to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Models found in the literature simulate specific areas of the CVS with limited direct usefulness to medical staff. Others model the full CVS as a closed loop system, but they were found to be very complex, difficult to solve, or unstable. This paper develops a model that uses a minimal number of governing equations with the primary goal of accurately capturing trends in the CVS dynamics in a simple, easily solved, robust model. The model is shown to have long term stability and consistency with non-specific initial conditions as a result. An \"open on pressure close on flow\" valve law is created to capture the effects of inertia and the resulting dynamics of blood flow through the cardiac valves. An accurate, stable solution is performed using a method that varies the number of states in the model depending on the specific phase of the cardiac cycle, better matching the real physiological conditions. Examples of results include a 9% drop in cardiac output when increasing the thoracic pressure from -4 to 0 mmHg, and an increase in blood pressure from 120\/80 to 165\/130 mmHg when the systemic resistance is doubled. These results show that the model adequately provides appropriate magnitudes and trends that are in agreement with existing data for a variety of physiologically verified test cases simulating human CVS function. \n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMinimal haemodynamic system model including ventricular interaction and valve dynamics, Bram W Smith, J Geoffrey Chase, Roger I Nokes, Geoffrey M Shaw, Graeme Wake, 2004, *Medical Engineering and Physics*, 26, 131-139.

The goal of this approach is to contribute to modelling of the effects of disturbances to metabolism, associated with ischaemic heart disease, on cardiac cell function. The approach is illustrated for the sodium-potassium pump in the myocyte. The lumping scheme is applied to produce a 4-state representation from the detailed 15-state model of Lauger and Apell, Eur.

We construct a model of the IP(3) receptor and fit the model to dynamic and steady-state experimental data from type-2 IP(3) receptors. Our results indicate that, (i) Ca(2+) binds to the receptor using saturating, not mass-action, kinetics; (ii) Ca(2+) decreases the rate of IP(3) binding while simultaneously increasing the steady-state sensitivity of the receptor to IP(3); (iii) the rate of Ca(2+)-induced receptor activation increases with Ca(2+) and is faster than Ca(2+)-induced receptor inactivation; and (iv) IP(3) receptors are sequentially activated and inactivated by Ca(2+) even when IP(3) is bound.

In addition, the effects of blocking membrane transport or reducing Ca(2+) entry vary from one cell type to another; in some cell types oscillations persist in the absence of Ca(2+) entry (although their frequency is affected), whereas in other cell types oscillations depend on Ca(2+) entry. We present theoretical and experimental evidence that membrane transport can control oscillations by controlling the total amount of Ca(2+) in the cell (the Ca(2+) load). Our model predicts that the cell can be balanced at a point where small changes in the Ca(2+) load can move the cell into or out of oscillatory regions, resulting in the appearance or disappearance of oscillations. Our theoretical predictions are verified by experimental results from HEK293 cells. We predict that the role of Ca(2+) influx during an oscillation is to replenish the Ca(2+) load of the cell. Despite this prediction, even during the peak of an oscillation the cell or the endoplasmic reticulum may not be measurably depleted of Ca(2+).",

We present a detailed analysis of the intercellular wave in a two-dimensional sheet of cells. The model is based on the hypothesis that the wave is the result of diffusion of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from the stimulated cell. The two-dimensional model agrees well with experimental data and makes the following quantitative predictions: as the distance from the stimulated cells increases, 1) the intercellular delay increases exponentially, 2) the intracellular wave speed decreases exponentially, and 3) the arrival time increases exponentially. Furthermore, 4) a proportion of the cells at the periphery of the response will exhibit waves of decreased amplitude, 5) the intercellular membrane permeability to IP3 must be approximately 2 microns\/s or greater, and 6) the ratio of the maximum concentration of IP3 in the stimulated cell to the Km of the IP3 receptor (with respect to IP3) must be approximately 300 or greater.

In this study, cardiocyte Ca(2+) dynamics were modeled using a set of six differential equations that were based on theories, equations, and parameters described in previous studies. Among the unique features of the model was the inclusion of bidirectional modulatory interplay between the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca(2+) release channel (SRRC) and calsequestrin (CSQ) in the SR lumen, where CSQ acted as a dynamic rather than simple Ca(2+) buffer, and acted as a Ca(2+) sensor in the SR lumen as well. The inclusion of this control mechanism was central in overcoming a number of assumptions that would otherwise have to be made about SRRC kinetics, SR Ca(2+) release rates, and SR Ca(2+) release termination when the SR lumen is assumed to act as a simple, buffered Ca(2+) sink. The model was sufficient to reproduce a graded Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) response, CICR with high gain, and a system with reasonable stability. As constructed, the model successfully replicated the results of several previously published experiments that dealt with the Ca(2+) dependence of the SRRC (, J. Gen. Physiol. 85:247-289), the refractoriness of the SRRC (, Am. J. Physiol. 270:C148-C159), the SR Ca(2+) load dependence of SR Ca(2+) release (, Am. J. Physiol. 268:C1313-C1329;, J. Biol.

J. 73:1524-1531), and a variety of contraction frequency-dependent alterations in sarcoplasmic [Ca(2+)] dynamics that are normally observed in the laboratory, including rest potentiation, a negative frequency-[Ca(2+)] relationship, and extrasystolic potentiation. Furthermore, under the condition of a simulated Ca(2+) overload, an alternans-like state was produced. In summary, the current model of cardiocyte Ca(2+) dynamics provides an integrated theoretical framework of fundamental cellular Ca(2+) regulatory processes that is sufficient to predict a broad array of observable experimental outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Mathematical Model of Cardiocyte Ca2+ Dynamics with a Novel Representation of Sarcoplasmic Reticular Ca2+ Control, Steven M.

A ternary positive feedback loop with only positive regulations is constructed with elements that activates the subsequent element in a clockwise fashion. A ternary negative feedback loop with only negative regulations is constructed with the elements that inhibit the subsequent element in an anticlockwise fashion. Positive feedback loop exhibits bistability, whereas the negative feedback loop exhibits limit cycle oscillations. The novelty of the topology is that the corresponding elements in these two homogeneous feedback loops are linked by the binary positive feedback loops with only positive regulations. This results in the emergence of mixed feedback loops in the network that displays complex behaviour like the coexistence of multiple steady states, relaxation oscillations and chaos. Importantly, the arrangement of the feedback loops brings in the notion of checkpoint in the model. The model also exhibits domino-like behaviour, where the limit cycle oscillations take place in a stepwise fashion. As the aforementioned topology is abstracted from the budding yeast cell cycle, the events that govern the cell cycle are considered for the present study. In budding yeast, the sequential activation of the transcription factors, cyclins and their inhibitors form mixed feedback loops. The transcription factors that involve in the positive regulation in a clockwise orientation generates ternary positive feedback loop, while the cyclins and their inhibitors that involve in the negative regulation in an anticlockwise orientation generates ternary negative feedback loop. The mutual regulation between the corresponding elements in the transcription factors and the cyclins and their inhibitors generates binary positive feedback loops. The bifurcation diagram constructed for the whole system can be related to the different events of the cell cycle in terms of dynamical system theory. The checkpoint mechanism that plays an important role in different phases of the cell cycle are accounted for by silencing appropriate feedback loops in the model.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\nA minimal mathematical model combining several regulatory cycles from the budding yeast cell cycle, K.

        "abstract":"In cardiac muscle, release of activator calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs by calcium- induced calcium release through ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are clustered in a dense, regular, two-dimensional lattice array at the diad junction. We simulated numerically the stochastic dynamics of RyRs and L-type sarcolemmal calcium channels interacting via calcium nano-domains in the junctional cleft. Four putative RyR gating schemes based on single-channel measurements in lipid bilayers all failed to give stable excitation\u2013contraction coupling, due either to insufficiently strong inactivation to terminate locally regenerative calcium-induced calcium release or insufficient cooperativity to discriminate against RyR activation by background calcium. If the ryanodine receptor was represented, instead, by a phenomenological four-state gating scheme, with channel opening resulting from simultaneous binding of two Ca(2+) ions, and either calcium-dependent or activation-linked inactivation, the simulations gave a good semiquantitative accounting for the macroscopic features of excitation\u2013contraction coupling. It was possible to restore stability to a model based on a bilayer-derived gating scheme, by introducing allosteric interactions between nearest-neighbor RyRs so as to stabilize the inactivated state and produce cooperativity among calcium binding sites on different RyRs. Such allosteric coupling between RyRs may be a function of the foot process and lattice array, explaining their conservation during evolution.",

        "abstract":"A detailed mathematical model for the fission yeast mitotic cycle is developed based on positive and negative feedback loops by which Cdc13\/Cdc2 kinase activates and inactivates itself. Positive feedbacks are created by Cdc13\/Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of specific substrates: inactivating its negative regulators (Rum1, Ste9 and Wee1\/Mik1) and activating its positive regulator (Cdc25). A slow negative feedback loop is turned on during mitosis by activation of Slp1\/anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which indirectly re-activates the negative regulators, leading to a drop in Cdc13\/Cdc2 activity and exit from mitosis. The model explains how fission yeast cells can exit mitosis in the absence of Ste9 (Cdc13 degradation) and Rum1 (an inhibitor of Cdc13\/Cdc2). We also show that, if the positive feedback loops accelerating the G(2)\/M transition (through Wee1 and Cdc25) are weak, then cells can reset back to G(2) from early stages of mitosis by premature activation of the negative feedback loop. This resetting can happen more than once, resulting in a quantized distribution of cycle times, as observed experimentally in wee1(\u2212) cdc25\u0394 mutant cells. Our quantitative description of these quantized cycles demonstrates the utility of mathematical modeling, because these cycles cannot be understood by intuitive arguments alone.",

        "abstract":"Spontaneous episodic activity is a fundamental mode of operation of developing networks. Surprisingly, the duration of an episode of activity correlates with the length of the silent interval that precedes it, but not with the interval that follows. Here we use a modeling approach to explain this characteristic, but thus far unexplained, feature of developing networks. Because the correlation pattern is observed in networks with different structures and components, a satisfactory model needs to generate the right pattern of activity regardless of the details of network architecture or individual cell properties. We thus developed simple models incorporating excitatory coupling between heterogeneous neurons and activity-dependent synaptic depression. These models robustly generated episodic activity with the correct correlation pattern. The correlation pattern resulted from episodes being triggered at random levels of recovery from depression while they terminated around the same level of depression. To explain this fundamental difference between episode onset and termination, we used a mean field model, where only average activity and average level of recovery from synaptic depression are considered. In this model, episode onset is highly sensitive to inputs. Thus noise resulting from random coincidences in the spike times of individual neurons led to the high variability at episode onset and to the observed correlation pattern. This work further shows that networks with widely different architectures, different cell types, and different functions all operate according to the same general mechanism early in their development.",

DA (at micromolar concentration) opens potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the lactotrophs and thus preventing the calcium influx that triggers prolactin hormone release. Surprisingly, at concentrations ~1000 lower, DA can stimulate prolactin secretion. Here, we investigated whether an increase in a K(+) current could mediate this stimulatory effect. We considered the fast K(+) currents flowing through large-conductance BK channels and through A-type channels. We developed a minimal lactotroph model to investigate the effects of these two currents. Both I(BK) and I(A) could transform the electrical pattern of activity from spiking to bursting, but through distinct mechanisms. I(BK) always increased the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, while I(A) could either increase or decrease it. Thus, the stimulatory effects of DA could be mediated by a fast K(+) conductance which converts tonically spiking cells to bursters. In addition, the study illustrates that a heterogeneous distribution of fast K(+) conductances could cause heterogeneous lactotroph firing patterns.",

Therefore, the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells that, while including a high level of electrophysiological detail, is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic currents: the fast sodium, L-type calcium, transient outward, rapid and slow delayed rectifier, and inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium dynamics, allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium transients, calcium current inactivation, and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human epicardial, endocardial, and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration restitution, which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. Finally, we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of 265 ms.

However despite their prevalance, they remain relatively poorly understood. Mathematical models, which capture the function of the beating human heart, play an important role in cardiac research. In part this is because practical experiments on human hearts are limited, and animal hearts may differ significantly in their anatomy and physiology relative to the human heart.

According to one hypothesis, the chaotic excitation dynamics during VF are the result of dynamical instabilities in action potential duration (APD) the occurrence of which requires that the slope of the APD restitution curve exceeds 1. Other factors such as electrotonic coupling and cardiac memory also determine whether these instabilities can develop. In this paper we study the conditions for alternans and spiral breakup in human cardiac tissue. Therefore, we develop a new version of our human ventricular cell model, which is based on recent experimental measurements of human APD restitution and includes a more extensive description of intracellular calcium dynamics. We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical instability in single cells, for reentrant waves in a ring of cells, and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue. We show that an important determinant for the onset of instability is the recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower sodium current recovery leads to longer periods of spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction velocity restitution, both of which suppress restitution-mediated instability. As a result, maximum restitution slopes considerably exceeding 1 (up to 1.5) may be necessary for electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for the onset of instabilities found in our study exceed 1, they are within the range of experimentally measured slopes. Therefore, we conclude that steep APD restitution-mediated instability is a potential mechanism for VF in the human heart.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nAlternans and spiral breakup in a human ventricular tissue model, K.H.W.J. ten Tusscher, A.V.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gemcitabine was given thrice weekly on days 1 and 8 in combination with carboplatin, which was given only on day 1 of every cycle. Gemcitabine amount in the body and area under the concentration-time curves of plasma gemcitabine, 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine, and intracellular gemcitabine triphosphate in white cells were compared to determine which best describes tumor shrinkage over time. Tumor growth kinetics were described using a Gompertz-like model. RESULTS: The apparent half-life for the effect of gemcitabine was 7.67 weeks. The tumor turnover time constant was 21.8 week.cm. Baseline tumor size and gemcitabine amount in the body to attain 50% of tumor shrinkage were estimated to be 6.66 cm and 10,600 mg. There was no evidence of relapse during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Concentration-based exposure metrics for gemcitabine and its metabolites were no better than gemcitabine amount in predicting tumor shrinkage in primary lung cancer lesions. Gemcitabine dose-based models did marginally better than treatment-based models that ignored doses of drug administered to patients.

It is possible, however, to interpret seemingly conflicting results of clinical studies in terms of their different experimental conditions with respect to the hepatic glucose release. If this release is operating near an upper limit, an oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering the blood glucose level than a constant supply. If the insulin level is high enough for the hepatic release of glucose to nearly vanish, the opposite effect is observed. For insulin concentrations close to the point of inflection of the insulin-glucose dose-response curve an oscillatory and a constant insulin infusion produce similar effects. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nModelling the Insulin-Glucose Feedback System: The Significance of Pulsatile Insulin Secretion, Iva Marija Tolic, Erik Mosekilde and Jeppe Sturis, 2000, *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 207, 361-375.

        "abstract":"Uterine contractions during labor are discretely regulated by rhythmic action potentials (AP) of varying duration and form that serve to determine calcium-dependent force production. We have employed a computational biology approach to develop a fuller understanding of the complexity of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling of uterine smooth muscle cells (USMC). Our overall aim is to establish a mathematical platform of sufficient biophysical detail to quantitatively describe known uterine E-C coupling parameters and thereby inform future empirical investigations of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms governing normal and dysfunctional labors. From published and unpublished data we construct mathematical models for fourteen ionic currents of USMCs: [Image: see text] currents (L- and T-type), [Image: see text] current, an hyperpolarization-activated current, three voltage-gated [Image: see text] currents, two [Image: see text]-activated [Image: see text] current, [Image: see text]-activated [Image: see text] current, non-specific cation current, [Image: see text]-[Image: see text] exchanger, [Image: see text]-[Image: see text] pump and background current. The magnitudes and kinetics of each current system in a spindle shaped single cell with a specified surface area\u2236volume ratio is described by differential equations, in terms of maximal conductances, electrochemical gradient, voltage-dependent activation\/inactivation gating variables and temporal changes in intracellular [Image: see text] computed from known [Image: see text] fluxes. These quantifications are validated by the reconstruction of the individual experimental ionic currents obtained under voltage-clamp. Phasic contraction is modeled in relation to the time constant of changing [Image: see text]. This integrated model is validated by its reconstruction of the different USMC AP configurations (spikes, plateau and bursts of spikes), the change from bursting to plateau type AP produced by estradiol and of simultaneous experimental recordings of spontaneous AP, [Image: see text] and phasic force. In summary, our advanced mathematical model provides a powerful tool to investigate the physiological ionic mechanisms underlying the genesis of uterine electrical E-C coupling of labor and parturition. This will furnish the evolution of descriptive and predictive quantitative models of myometrial electrogenesis at the whole cell and tissue levels.",

        "abstract":"The electrical excitability of uterine smooth muscle cells is a key determinant of the contraction of the organ during labor and is manifested by spontaneous, periodic action potentials (APs). Near the end of term, APs vary in shape and size reflecting an ability to change the frequency, duration and amplitude of uterine contractions. A recent mathematical model quantified several ionic features of the electrical excitability in uterine smooth muscle cells. It replicated many of the experimentally recorded uterine AP configurations but its limitations were evident when trying to simulate the long-duration bursting APs characteristic of labor. A computational parameter search suggested that delayed rectifying K(+) currents could be a key model component requiring improvement to produce the longer-lasting bursting APs. Of the delayed rectifying K(+) currents family it is of interest that KCNQ and hERG channels have been reported to be gestationally regulated in the uterus. These currents exhibit features similar to the broadly defined uterine I (K1) of the original mathematical model. We thus formulated new quantitative descriptions for several I (KCNQ) and I (hERG). Incorporation of these currents into the uterine cell model enabled simulations of the long-lasting bursting APs. Moreover, we used this modified model to simulate the effects of different contributions of I (KCNQ) and I (hERG) on AP form. Our findings suggest that the alterations in expression of hERG and KCNQ channels can potentially provide a mechanism for fine tuning of AP forms that lends a malleability for changing between plateau-like and long-lasting bursting-type APs as uterine cells prepare for parturition.",

The primary variables of this system are beta-cell mass, plasma insulin concentrations, and plasma glucose concentrations. Existing mathematical models of glucose regulation incorporate only glucose and\/or insulin dynamics. Here we develop a novel model of beta-cell mass, insulin, and glucose dynamics, which consists of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where glucose and insulin dynamics are fast relative to beta-cell mass dynamics. For normal parameter values, the model has two stable fixed points (representing physiological and pathological steady states), separated on a slow manifold by a saddle point. Mild hyperglycemia leads to the growth of the beta-cell mass (negative feedback) while extreme hyperglycemia leads to the reduction of the beta-cell mass (positive feedback). The model predicts that there are three pathways in prolonged hyperglycemia: (1) the physiological fixed point can be shifted to a hyperglycemic level (regulated hyperglycemia), (2) the physiological and saddle points can be eliminated (bifurcation), and (3) progressive defects in glucose and\/or insulin dynamics can drive glucose levels up at a rate faster than the adaptation of the beta-cell mass which can drive glucose levels down (dynamical hyperglycemia).\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA Model of Beta-cell Mass, Insulin, and Glucose Kinetics: Pathways to Diabetes, Brian Topp, Keith Promislow, Gerda de Vries, Robert M.

Our model, based on a model of cross-bridge kinetics that was developed by others, reproduces many of the observed effects of MgATP, MgADP, Pi, and H(+) on force development while retaining the force\/length\/Ca(2+) properties of the original model. We introduce three new parameters to account for the competitive binding of H(+) to the Ca(2+) binding site on troponin C and the binding of MgADP within the cross-bridge cycle. These parameters, along with the Pi and H(+) regulatory steps within the cross-bridge cycle, were constrained using data from the literature and validated using a range of metabolic and sinusoidal length perturbation protocols. The placement of the MgADP binding step between two strongly-bound and force-generating states leads to the emergence of an unexpected effect on the force-MgADP curve, where the trend of the relationship (positive or negative) depends on the concentrations of the other metabolites and [H(+)].

Optimization of model parameters to fit experimental data favors a fully cooperative Ca(2+)-binding mechanism and predicts a Ca(2+)\/H(+) counter-transport stoichiometry of 2. Moreover, the order of binding of the partial reactions, particularly the binding of MgATP, proves to be a strong determinant of the ability of the model to fit the data.

Conventional existing tests rely on nonhuman models which deliver an incomplete metabolic profile of drugs due to the lack of proper CYP450 expression as seen in human liver in vivo. In order to overcome this limitation, we used an organotypical model of human primary hepatocytes for the biotransformation of the drug diazepam with special reference to metabolites in both the cell matrix phase and supernatant and its interaction of three inducers (phenobarbital, dexamethasone, aroclor 1254) in different time responses (1, 2, 4, 8, 24 h). Phenobarbital showed the strongest inducing effect in generating desmethyldiazepam and induced up to a 150 fold increase in oxazepam-content which correlates with the increased availability of the precursor metabolites (temazepam and desmethyldiazepam). Aroclor 1254 and dexamethasone had the strongest inducing effect on temazepam and the second strongest on oxazepam. The strong and overlapping inductive role of phenobarbital strengthens the participation of CYP2B6 and CYP3A in diazepam N-demethylation and CYP3A in temazepam formation. Aroclor 1254 preferentially generated temazepam due to the interaction with CYP3A and potentially CYP2C19. In parallel we represented these data in the form of a mathematical model with two compartments explaining the dynamics of diazepam metabolism with the effect of these other inducers in human primary hepatocytes. The model consists of ten differential equations, with one for each concentration c(i,j) (i=diazepam, temazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, other metabolites) and one for each compartment (j= cell matrix phase, supernatant), respectively. The parameters p(k) (k=1, 2, 3, 4, 13) are rate constants describing the biotransformation of diazepam and its metabolites and the other parameters (k=5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15) explain the concentration changes in the two compartments.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Two compartment model of diazepam biotransformation in an organotypical culture of primary human hepatocytes, Ali Acikgoz et al, 2009, *Toxicology and applied pharmacology*, 234, 179-191.

Although the gene regulatory network that produces daily oscillations within individual neurons is well characterized, less is known about the electrophysiology of the SCN cells and how firing rate correlates with circadian gene expression. We developed a firing rate code model to incorporate known electrophysiological properties of SCN pacemaker cells, including circadian dependent changes in membrane voltage and ion conductances. Calcium dynamics were included in the model as the putative link between electrical firing and gene expression. Individual ion currents exhibited oscillatory patterns matching experimental data both in current levels and phase relationships. VIP and GABA neurotransmitters, which encode synaptic signals across the SCN, were found to play critical roles in daily oscillations of membrane excitability and gene expression. Blocking various mechanisms of intracellular calcium accumulation by simulated pharmacological agents (nimodipine, IP3- and ryanodine-blockers) reproduced experimentally observed trends in firing rate dynamics and core-clock gene transcription. The intracellular calcium concentration was shown to regulate diverse circadian processes such as firing frequency, gene expression and system periodicity. The model predicted a direct relationship between firing frequency and gene expression amplitudes, demonstrated the importance of intracellular pathways for single cell behavior and provided a novel multiscale framework which captured characteristics of the SCN at both the electrophysiological and gene regulatory levels.",

Most of these clocks use intracellular genetic networks based on positive and negative regulatory elements.

We show that this type of oscillator is driven mainly by two elements: the concentration of a repressor protein and the dynamics of an activator protein forming an inactive complex with the repressor. Thus, the clock does not need to rely on mRNA dynamics to oscillate, which makes it especially resistant to fluctuations. Oscillations can be present even when the time average of the number of mRNA molecules goes below one. Under some conditions, this oscillator is not only resistant to but, paradoxically, also enhanced by the intrinsic biochemical noise.",

        "abstract":"Rates of ATPase and glycolysis are several times faster in actively contracting mouse extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) than soleus (SOL), but we find these rates are not distinguishable at rest. We used a transient anoxic perturbation of steady state energy balance to decrease phosphocreatine (PCr) reversibly and to measure the rates of ATPase and of lactate production without muscle activation or contraction. The rate of glycolytic ATP synthesis is less than the ATPase rate, accounting for the continual PCr decrease during anoxia in both muscles. We fitted a mathematical model validated with properties of enzymes and solutes measured in vitro and appropriate for the transient perturbation of these muscles to experimental data to test whether the model accounts for the results. Simulations showed equal rates of ATPase and lactate production in both muscles. ATPase controls glycolytic flux by feedback from its products. Adenylate kinase function is critical because a rise in [AMP] is necessary to activate glycogen phosphorylase. ATPase is the primary source of H(+) production. The sum of contributions of the 13 reactions of the glycogenolytic and glycolytic network to total proton load is negligible. The stoichiometry of lactate and H(+) production is near unity. These results identify a default state of energy metabolism for resting muscle in which there is no difference in the metabolic phenotype of EDL and SOL. Therefore, additional control mechanisms, involving higher ATPase flux and [Ca(2+)], must exist to explain the well-known difference in glycolytic rates in fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles in actively contracting muscle.",

The 2 components of the delayed rectifier potassium current, IKr (rapid) and IKs (slow), play a dominant role in the repolarization of the action potential and are important determinants of its duration. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report, the effects of heterogeneities of IKr and IKs on action potential duration (APD) and its rate dependence (adaptation) are studied with the use of the LRd model of a mammalian ventricular cell. Results demonstrate the importance of IKs density variations in heterogeneity of repolarization. Cells with reduced IKs (eg, mid-myocardial M cells) display long APD and steep dependence of APD on rate. Mechanistically, accumulation of IKs activation and increased sodium calcium exchange current, INaCa, secondary to Na+ accumulation at a fast rate underlie the steep APD-rate relation of these cells. When cells are electrotonically coupled in a multicellular fiber through resistive gap junction, APD differences are reduced. The results demonstrate strong dependence of APD heterogeneity on the degree of intercellular coupling even in the normal physiological range. Highly reduced coupling maximizes APD heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity of IKs:IKr density strongly influences APD and its rate dependence. However, in the intact myocardium, the degree of gap-junction coupling may be an important factor that determines the manifestation of APD heterogeneity and dispersion of repolarization. The clinical significance of this study is in the context of repolarization abnormalities and associated arrhythmias (eg, long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes).\n\n\n\n\nThe complete paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Effects of IKr and IKs heterogeneity on action potential duration and its rate dependence: a simulation study, Prakash C.

Binding of insulin to its cell surface receptor initiates signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular responses. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin receptor binding kinetics. Interestingly, negative cooperative interactions are observed at high insulin concentrations while positive cooperativity may be present at low insulin concentrations. Clearly, insulin receptor binding kinetics cannot be simply explained by a classical bimolecular reaction. Mature insulin receptors have a dimeric structure capable of binding two molecules of insulin. The binding affinity of the receptor for the second insulin molecule is significantly lower than for the first bound insulin molecule. In addition, insulin receptor aggregation occurs in response to ligand binding and aggregation may also influence binding kinetics. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for insulin receptor binding kinetics that explicitly represents the divalent nature of the insulin receptor and incorporates receptor aggregation into the kinetic model. Model parameters are based upon published data where available. Computer simulations with our model are capable of reproducing both negative and positive cooperativity at the appropriate insulin concentrations. This model may be a useful tool for helping to understand the mechanisms underlying insulin receptor binding and the coupling of receptor binding to downstream signaling events. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nInsulin receptor binding kinetics: modeling and simulation studies, Sumanas Wanant and Michael J.

Through quantitative measurements that systematically canvas an array of stimulation and molecular perturbation conditions, together with computational modeling and analysis, we have elucidated cross-talk mechanisms in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling network, in which phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways are prominently activated. We show that, while PI3K signaling is insulated from cross-talk, PI3K enhances Erk activation at points both upstream and downstream of Ras. The magnitudes of these effects depend strongly on the stimulation conditions, subject to saturation effects in the respective pathways and negative feedback loops. Motivated by those dynamics, a kinetic model of the network was formulated and used to precisely quantify the relative contributions of PI3K-dependent and -independent modes of Ras\/Erk activation.",

The quantitative effect of ATP concentration upon the oscillations was successfully simulated. Our simulation results support previous experimental explanations that the Ca(2+) oscillations are mainly due to interaction of Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ATP-dependent Ca(2+) pump back into the ER, and the oscillations are prolonged by extracellular Ca(2+) entry that maintains the constant Ca(2+) supplies to its intracellular stores. The model is also able to simulate the sudden disappearance phenomenon of the Ca(2+) oscillations observed in some cell types by taking into account of the biphasic characteristic of the Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, the model simulation results for the Ca(2+) oscillations characteristics such as duration, peak [Ca(2+)](cyt), and average interval, etc., lead to prediction of some possible factors responsible for the variations of Ca(2+) oscillations in different types of cells.\n \n\n\n\n The original paper is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n A quantitative kinetic model for ATP-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations.

The analytical results show the existence and uniqueness of a stable periodic solution that corresponds to ultradian insulin secretion oscillations. Numerically we simulate the insulin administration based on our model. The numerical simulation results are in agreement with findings of clinical studies.\n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMathematical modeling and qualitative analysis of insulin therapies, Haiyan Wang, Jiaxu Li, and Yang Kuang, 2007, *Mathematical Biosciences* 210, 17-33.

In this study, we investigated the effects of riluzole on ion currents in cultured differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (dHSkMCs). Western blotting revealed the protein expression of greek small letter alpha-subunits for both large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channel and Na+ channel (Nav1.5) in these cells. Riluzole could reduce the frequency of spontaneous beating in dHSkMCs. In whole-cell configuration, riluzole suppressed voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 2.3 uM. Riluzole (10 uM) also effectively increased Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK(Ca)) which could be reversed by iberiotoxin (200 nM) and paxilline (1 uM), but not by apamin (200 nM). In inside-out patches, when applied to the inside of the cell membrane, riluzole (10 uM) increased BKCa-channel activity with a decrease in mean closed time. Simulation studies also unraveled that both decreased conductance of INa and increased conductance of IK(Ca) utilized to mimic riluzole actions in skeletal muscle cells could combine to decrease the amplitude of action potentials and increase the repolarization of action potentials. Taken together, inhibition of INa and stimulation of BKCa-channel activity caused by this drug are partly, if not entirely, responsible for its muscle relaxant actions in clinical setting. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nEffect of riluzole on action potential in cultured human skeletal muscle cells, Ya-Jean Wang, Ming-Wei Lin, An-An Lin, Sheng-Nan Wu, 2007, *Life Sciences*, 82, 11-20.

The dramatic differences in action potential (AP) shape between neonatal and adult cardiac myocytes, however, indicate that a different set of molecular interactions in neonatal myocytes necessitates different treatment for newborns. Computational modeling is useful for synthesizing data to determine how interactions between components lead to systems-level behavior, but this technique has not been used extensively to study neonatal heart cell function. We created a mathematical model of the neonatal (day 1) mouse myocyte by modifying, based on experimental data, the densities and\/or formulations of ion transport mechanisms in an adult cell model. The new model reproduces the characteristic AP shape of neonatal cells, with a brief plateau phase and longer duration than the adult (APD(80)=60.1 vs. 12.6 ms). The simulation results are consistent with experimental data, including: 1) decreased density, and altered inactivation, of transient outward K(+) currents, 2) increased delayed rectifier K(+) currents, 3) Ca(2+) entry through T-type as well as L-type Ca(2+) channels, 4) increased Ca(2+) influx through Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange, and 5) Ca(2+) transients resulting from transmembrane Ca(2+) entry rather than release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Simulations performed with the model generated novel predictions, including increased SR Ca(2+) leak and elevated intracellular [Na(+)] in neonatal compared with adult myocytes. This new model can therefore be used for testing hypotheses and obtaining a better quantitative understanding of differences between neonatal and adult physiology.",

Two classes of mechanism have been proposed to explain calcium wave propagation: diffusion through gap junctions of the intracellular messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and diffusion of paracrine extracellular messengers such as ATP. We have used single cell recordings of airway epithelium to parametreize a model of an airway epithelial cell. This was then incorporated into a spatial model of a cell culture where both mechanisms for calcium wave propagation are possible. It is shown that a decreasing return on the radius of Ca2+ wave propagation is achieved as the amount of ATP released from the stimulated cell increases. It is therefore shown that for a Ca2+ wave to propagate large distances, a significant fraction of the intracellular ATP pool would be required to be released. Further to this, the radial distribution of maximal calcium response from the stimulated cell does not produce the same flat profile of maximal calcium response seen in experiential studies. This suggests that an additional mechanism is important in Ca2+ wave propagation, such as regenerative release of ATP from cells downstream of the stimulated cell.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nMathematical modelling of calcium wave propagation in mammalian airway epithelium: evidence for regenerative ATP release, N.J.

However, in an evolutionary arms race between the host immune system and the tumour, some tumour cells have developed various strategies to evade both stages of the host immune response. \n\n\n\n\nOne of these strategies is for tumour cells to kill activated lymphocytes through their synthesis and secretion of the death ligand, FasL. This ligand binds to the death receptor Fas (also known as CD95) which is expressed on the surface of the activated lymphocytes, and this interaction triggers the apoptotic pathway in the lymphocyte. The binding of Fas and FasL can be controlled, at least in part, by the cleavage of FasL into a smaller, less cytotoxic, soluble form (sFasL) by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). In addition, certain cells are able to secrete sFasL by alternate splicing of Fas mRNA transcripts. In combination, both these phenomena can lead to the down-regulation of the immune response. \n\n\n\n\nTumour-immune cell dynamics have been the subject of several theoretical studies. In the paper described here, Steven Webb, Jonathan Sherratt and Reginald Fish have developed a mathematical model of the Fas\/FasL system to investigate Fas-FasL binding and the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis in the process of tumour-induced immunosupression. Model simulations demonstrate how the constitutive expression of FasL by tumour cells is a potential mechanism of immune evasion, and the model predicts that sFasL can act as an inhibitor of the Fas death signal. In addition the model considers the enzymatic cleavage of FasL into sFasL, and predicts that the inhibition of MMP cleavage activity causes Fas sensitive lymphocytes to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis faster than the Fas-resistant tumour cells.\n\n\n\n\nThe model consists of a set of ordinary differential equations which represent the binding of Fas and FasL for each cell type. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n[Cells behaving badly: a theoretical model for the Fas\/FasL system in tumour immunology](http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VHX-46HBR2D-3&_user=140507&_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2002&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_cdi=6078&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000011498&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=140507&md5=5bc281e567eb98631e8d4077ee0c9da1), Steven D.

The model incorporates two cell types (CD4+ T cells and a long-lived pool of cells), two strains of virus (drug-sensitive wild type and drug-resistant mutant) and two types of antiretroviral agents (reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors). The transient behavior of the cells and virus and the eventual eradication of the virus are determined primarily by the strength of the combination therapy against the mutant strain and the maximum achievable increase in the uninfected CD4+ T cell concentration. We also predict, if the parameters of the model remain constant during therapy, that less intensive maintenance regimens will be unable to maintain low viral loads for extensive periods of time. However, if the reduction in viral load produced by therapy reduces the state of activation of the immune system, the number of cells susceptible for HIV-1 infection may decrease even though total CD4+ T cells increase. Our model predicts that if this occurs strong inductive therapy that reduces viral load followed by weaker maintenance regimes may succeed.\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\nMathematical analysis of antiretroviral therapy aimed at HIV-1 eradication or maintenance of low viral loads, Wein L, D'Amato R, Perelson A, 1998, *Journal of Theoretical Biology*, 192, 81-98.

It has been curated, the units are consistent and the model runs in COR and PCEnv to replicate the published results.\n\n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) has been developed, consisting of a-intercalated cells and a paracellular pathway, and which includes Na, K, Cl, HCO3, CO2, H2CO3, phosphate, ammonia, and urea. Proton secretion across the luminal cell membrane is mediated by both H-ATPase and H-K-ATPase, with fluxes through the H-K-ATPase given by a previously developed kinetic model (Weinstein AM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 274: F856-F867, 1998). The flux across each ATPase is substantial, and variation in abundance of either pump can be used to control OMCD proton secretion. In comparison with the H-ATPase, flux through the H-K-ATPase is relatively insensitive to changes in lumen pH, so as luminal acidification proceeds, proton secretion shifts toward this pathway. Peritubular HCO3 exit is via a conductive pathway and via the Cl\/HCO3 exchanger, AE1. To represent AE1, a kinetic model has been developed based on transport studies obtained at 38 degrees celcius in red blood cells. (Gasbjerg PK, Knauf PA, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 565-575, 1996; Knauf PA, Gasbjerg PK, and Brahm J. J Gen Physiol 108: 577-589, 1996). Model calculations indicate that if all of the chloride entry via AE1 recycles across a peritubular chloride channel and if this channel is anything other than highly selective for chloride, then it should conduct a substantial fraction of the bicarbonate exit. Since both luminal membrane proton pumps are sensitive to small changes in cytosolic pH, variation in density of either AE1 or peritubular anion conductance can modulate OMCD proton secretory rate. With respect to the OMCD in situ, available buffer is predicted to be abundant, including delivered HCO3 and HPO4, as well as peritubular NH3. Thus, buffer availability is unlikely to exert a regulatory role in total proton secretion by this tubule segment.\n \n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n \n\n\n\n A mathematical model of the outer medullary collecting duct of the rat, A.M.

The model comprises the enzymatic reactions from glucokinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD). Our results show, for a substantial part of the parameter space, an oscillatory behavior of the glycolysis for a large range of glucose concentrations. We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on glucokinase, aldolase and\/or GAPD activities, and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase and\/or GAPD activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose responsiveness, rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. Methodologically, we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers. We emphasize the use of parameter ranges rather than fixed values, and the use of operationally well-defined parameters in order for this methodology to be feasible.

Most often this bursting is periodic, but in some cases it is modulated by an underlying slower rhythm. We suggest that the modulatory rhythm for this complex bursting pattern is due to oscillations in glycolysis, while the bursting itself is generated by some other slow process. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we couple a minimal model of glycolytic oscillations to a minimal model for activity-dependent bursting in islets. We show that the combined model can reproduce several complex bursting patterns from mouse islets published in the literature, and we illustrate how these complex oscillations are produced through the use of a fast\/slow analysis.\n\n\n\n Complex bursting in pancreatic islets: a potential glycolytic mechanism, Wierschem, Bertram, 2004, *Journal of Theoretical Biology*\n , 228, 513-521.

Successive hyperpolarizing pulses induced increasingly higher rates of tonic firing that remained stable for tens of seconds, allowing the neuron to retain a memory of the previous history of stimulation. This phenomenon occurred at the cellular level and in the absence of neuromodulators. Neurons with HAGPA had a sag during hyperpolarization, and blocking h-current eliminated the sag and prevented HAGPA, suggesting that the activation of this hyperpolarization-activated cationic current was necessary for the occurrence of the phenomenon. A single-neuron biophysical model including h-current modulation by intracellular calcium was able to display HAGPA. This form of neuronal memory not only allows the transformation of inhibition into an increase of firing rate, but also endows neurons with a mechanism to compute the properties of successive inputs into persistent activity, thus solving a difficult computational problem.",

Only the number of expressed channels is reduced (the control may be pre- or post-transcriptional but it is not post-translational). On the basis of these data, the effects of terminal heart failure are modelled by reducing the peak conductance of i\\_to1 and i\\_K1. Downregulation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump is modelled by simultaneous scaling of both the forward and reverse maximum pump rates Vmaxf and Vmaxr by a scale factor KSR. Upregulation of the Na-Ca exchanger is modelled by increasing a scale factor KNaCa. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms of Altered Excitation-Contraction Coupling in Canine Tachycardia-Induced Heart Failure, II Model Studies, Raimond L.

It is defined as an elevated number of specific immune cells that remain after resolution of infection and can protect the host against reinfection. The evolution of immunological memory is subject to debate. The advantages of memory discussed so far include protection from reinfection, control of chronic infection, and the transfer of immune function to the next generation. Mathematical models are used to identify a new force that can drive the evolution of immunological memory: the duration of memory can regulate the degree of competition between different pathogens. While a long duration of memory provides lasting protection against reinfection, it may also allow an inferior pathogen species to persist. This can be detrimental for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. On the other hand, a shorter duration of memory ensures that an inferior pathogen species is excluded. This can be beneficial for the host if the inferior pathogen is more virulent. Thus, while in the absence of pathogen diversity memory is always expected to evolve to a long duration, under specific circumstances, memory can evolve toward shorter durations in the presence of pathogen diversity. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of Immunological Memory and the Regulation of Competition between Pathogens, Dominik Wodarz, 2003, *Current Biology*, 13, 1648-1652.

We use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their own stimulation. We show that such auto-catalytic cell division can significantly enhance virus spread, and can also provide an additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral drug therapy. In addition, the initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their extinction. On the other hand, a low initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of HIV specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune impairment, lead to less efficient anti-viral effector responses, and thus speed up disease progression, especially if effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently boosted at the same time.",

At the same time, they can cause disease when induced inappropriately. Which factors regulate CTL and decide whether they should remain silent or react is open to debate. The phenomenon called cross-priming has received attention in this respect. That is, CTL expansion occurs if antigen is recognized on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). This is in contrast to direct presentation where antigen is seen on the surface of the target cells (e.g. infected cells or tumor cells). Here we introduce a mathematical model, which takes the phenomenon of cross-priming into account. We propose a new mechanism of regulation which is implicit in the dynamics of the CTL: According to the model, the ability of a CTL response to become established depends on the ratio of cross-presentation to direct presentation of the antigen. If this ratio is relatively high, CTL responses are likely to become established. If this ratio is relatively low, tolerance is the likely outcome. The behavior of the model includes a parameter region where the outcome depends on the initial conditions. We discuss our results with respect to the idea of self\/non-self discrimination and the danger signal hypothesis. We apply the model to study the role of CTL in cancer initiation, cancer evolution\/progression, and therapeutic vaccination against cancers.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nA dynamical perspective of CTL cross-priming and regulation: implications for cancer immunology, Dominik Wodarz and Vincent A.

The models suggest that an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory response is required to control the virus. We define CTL memory as long-term persistence of CTL precursors in the absence of antigen. Infection and depletion of CD4(+) T helper cells interfere with CTL memory generation, resulting in persistent viral replication and disease progression. We find that antiviral drug therapy during primary infection can enable the development of CTL memory. In chronically infected patients, specific treatment schedules, either including deliberate drug holidays or antigenic boosts of the immune system, can lead to a re-establishment of CTL memory.

        "abstract":"Upon acute viral infection, a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles at a relatively stable memory level. Recently, experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had resolved, some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as \u2018CTL memory inflation\u2019. In order to examine the dynamics of this system further, we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this model, a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer (NK) cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute infection, but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific CD8+T cells seen in humans as they age.",

The model includes the main steps of anaerobic glycolysis, and the production of ethanol and glycerol. Transmembrane diffusion of acetaldehyde is included, since it has been hypothesized that this substance mediates the interaction. Depending on the kinetic parameter, the single-cell model shows both stationary and oscillatory behaviour. This agrees with experimental data with respect to metabolite concentrations and phase shifts. The inclusion of intercellular coupling leads to a variety of dynamical modes, such as synchronous oscillations, and different kinds of asynchronous behavior. These oscillations can co-exist, leading to bi- and tri-rhythmicity. The corresponding parameter regions have been identified by a bifurcation analysis. The oscillatory dynamics of synchronized cell populations are investigated by calculating the phase responses to acetaldehyde pulses. Simulations are performed with respect to the synchronization of two subpopulations that are oscillating out of phase before mixing. The effect of the various process on synchronization is characterized quantitatively. While continuous exchange of acetaldehyde might synchronize the oscillations for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally. It is concluded either that addition to the transmembrane exchange of acetaldehyde, other processes may contribute to intercellular coupling, or that intracellular regulator feedback plays a role in the acceleration of the synchronization. for appropriate sets of parameter values, the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally.

This model is constructed based on detailed kinetics and thermodynamically balanced reaction mechanisms and a strict accounting of rapidly equilibrating biochemical species. Since building such a model requires introducing a large number of adjustable kinetic parameters, a correspondingly large amount of independent data from isolated mitochondria respiring on different substrates and subject to a variety of protocols is used to parameterize the model and ensure that it is challenged by a wide range of data corresponding to diverse conditions. The developed model is further validated by both in vitro data on isolated cardiac mitochondria and in vivo experimental measurements on human skeletal muscle. The validated model is used to predict the roles of NAD and ADP in regulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase fluxes, demonstrating that NAD is the more important regulator. Further model predictions reveal that a decrease of cytosolic pH value results in decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and a corresponding drop in the ability of the mitochondria to synthesize ATP at the hydrolysis potential required for cellular function. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\n Computer Modeling of Mitochondrial Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Metabolite Transport, and Electrophysiology, Fan Wu, Feng Yang, Kalyan C.

The simulation consisted of a Ca transient, Ca association and dissociation rate constants of troponin C, and CB on and off rate constants. We evaluated sarcomere isometric twitch contractions at a constant muscle length. We assumed that each CB cycle hydrolyzes one ATP and that the force-length area (FLA) quantifies the total mechanical energy generated by CB cycles in a twitch contraction. FLA is a linear version of pressure-volume area, which quantifies the total mechanical energy of cardiac twitch contraction and correlates linearly with cardiac oxygen consumption (H. Suga, Physiol. Rev. 70: 247-277, 1990). The simulation shows that the contractile efficiency varies with changes in the Ca transient and Ca and CB kinetics except when they simultaneously speed up or slow down proportionally. These results point to possible mechanisms underlying the constancy and variability of cardiac contractile efficiency. \n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\nConstancy and variability of contractile efficiency as a function of calcium and cross-bridge kinetics: simulation, Hiroki Yamaguchi, Miyako Takaki, Hiromi Matsubara, Shingo Yasuhara, and Hiroyuki Suga, 1996, *American Journal of Physiology*, 270, H1501-1508.

In this model four dynamic currents, the sodium current iNa, the slow inward current, is, the potassium current, iK, and the hyperpolarization-activated current, ih, in addition to a time-dependent leak current, i1 were included. The model simulated the spontaneous action potential the current voltage relationship, and the voltage clamp experiment in normal Tyrode solution of the rabbit S-A node. Furthermore, the changes of activity induced by the potassium current blocker Ba2+, by applying constant current, acetylcholine, and epinephrine were also reconstructed. It was strongly suggested that the pacemaker depolarization in the S-A node cell is mainly due to a gradual increase of iS during diastole, and that the contribution of iK is much less compared to the potassium current iK2 in the Purkinje fiber pacemaker depolarization. The rising phase of the action potential was due to iS and the plateau phase is determined by both the inactivation of iS and activation of iK.\n\n\n\n\nThe original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nReconstruction of sino-atrial node pacemaker potential based on the voltage clamp experiments, K.

It will recreate published results, although it only models a single organ (the liver) as well as the veins and arteries, and is based on a 5 year old boy. The model cannot replicate the population analysis described in the paper, which needs stochastic tools that are unavailable to CellML at present. \n \n\n\n#### Model Structure\n\n\n\nAbstract: Limited pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data are available to use in methadone dosing recommendations in pediatric patients for either opioid abstinence or analgesia. Considering the extreme inter-individual variability of absorption and metabolism of methadone, population-based PK would be useful to provide insight into the relationship between dose, blood concentrations, and clinical effects of methadone. To address this need, an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model has been constructed to systematically study methadone metabolism and PK. The model will facilitate the design of cost-effective studies that will evaluate methadone PK and PD relationships, and may be useful to guide methadone dosing in children. The PBPK model, which includes whole-body multi-organ distribution, plasma protein binding, metabolism, and clearance, is parameterized based on a database of pediatric PK parameters and data collected from clinical experiments. The model is further tailored and verified based on PK data from individual adults, then scaled appropriately to apply to children aged 0-24 months. Based on measured variability in CYP3A enzyme expression levels and plasma orosomucoid (ORM2) concentrations, a Monte-Carlo-based simulation of methadone kinetics in a pediatric population was performed. The simulation predicts extreme variability in plasma concentrations and clearance kinetics for methadone in the pediatric population, based on standard dosing protocols. In addition, it is shown that when doses are designed for individuals based on prior protein expression information, inter-individual variability in methadone kinetics may be greatly reduced. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete original paper reference is cited below:\n\n\n\n\nPopulation-based analysis of methadone distribution and metabolism using an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, Feng Yang, Xianping Tong, D.

        "abstract":"BACKGROUND: The asymptomatic phase of HIV infection is characterised by a slow decline of peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells. Why this decline is slow is not understood. One potential explanation is that the low average rate of homeostatic proliferation or immune activation dictates the pace of a \u201crunaway\u201d decline of memory CD4(+) T cells, in which activation drives infection, higher viral loads, more recruitment of cells into an activated state, and further infection events. We explore this hypothesis using mathematical models. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using simple mathematical models of the dynamics of T cell homeostasis and proliferation, we find that this mechanism fails to explain the time scale of CD4(+) memory T cell loss. Instead it predicts the rapid attainment of a stable set point, so other mechanisms must be invoked to explain the slow decline in CD4(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: A runaway cycle in which elevated CD4(+) T cell activation and proliferation drive HIV production and vice versa cannot explain the pace of depletion during chronic HIV infection. We summarize some alternative mechanisms by which the CD4(+) memory T cell homeostatic set point might slowly diminish. While none are mutually exclusive, the phenomenon of viral rebound, in which interruption of antiretroviral therapy causes a rapid return to pretreatment viral load and T cell counts, supports the model of virus adaptation as a major force driving depletion.",

This process is mediated by the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of AMPAR by cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, making cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) potential regulators of synaptic strength. In this study, we examined the role of phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2), a medium spiny neuron-enriched and cGMP-activated PDE, in AMPAR trafficking. We found that inhibiting PDE2 resulted in enhancement of dopamine-induced surface GluA1 expression in dopamine receptor 1-expressing medium spiny neurons. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that inhibition of PDE1 resulted in a decrease in surface AMPAR levels because of the allosteric activation of PDE2. The cross-regulation of PDE1 and PDE2 activities results in counterintuitive control of surface AMPAR expression, making it possible to regulate the directionality and magnitude of AMPAR trafficking.",

We used the models to test the hypothesis that phosphodiesterases act as functional barriers to diffusion, creating discrete cAMP signaling domains.

Finally, we modeled the anatomical structures in a cardiac myocyte diad, to predict the effects of anatomical diffusion barriers on cAMP compartmentation. When we incorporated experimentally informed model parameters to reconstruct an in silico subcellular sarcomeric space with spatially distinct cAMP production sites linked to caveloar domains, the models predict that under realistic conditions phosphodiesterases alone were insufficient to generate significant cAMP gradients.

The difference between the physiological and pathological effects resulting from the production of cAMP may be a function of appropriate compartmentation of cAMP signaling.

Many signal transduction pathways activate RhoA\u2014for instance, G\u03b1(q)-coupled Histamine 1 Receptor signaling via G\u03b1(q)-dependent activation of RhoGEFs such as p63. Although multiple upstream regulators of RhoA have been identified, the temporal regulation of RhoA and the coordination of different upstream components in its regulation have not been well characterized. In this study, live-cell measurement of RhoA activation revealed a biphasic increase of RhoA activity upon histamine stimulation. We showed that the first and second phase of RhoA activity are dependent on p63 and Ca(2+)\/PKC, respectively, and further identified phosphorylation of serine 240 on p115 RhoGEF by PKC to be the mechanistic link between PKC and RhoA. Combined approaches of computational modeling and quantitative measurement revealed that the second phase of RhoA activation is insensitive to rapid turning off of the receptor and is required for maintaining RhoA-mediated transcription after the termination of the receptor signaling. Thus, two divergent pathways enable both rapid activation and persistent signaling in receptor-mediated RhoA signaling via intricate temporal regulation.",
