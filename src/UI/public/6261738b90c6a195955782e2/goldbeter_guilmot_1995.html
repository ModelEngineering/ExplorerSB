<h2>Model Structure</h2>

<p>
ABSTRACT:We consider a minimal cascade model previously proposed ~1 for the mitotic oscillator driving the 
embryonic cell division cycle. The model is based on a bicyclic phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascade 
involving cyclin and cdc2 kinase. By constructing stability diagrams showing domains of periodic behavior as a 
function of the maximum rates of the kinases and phosphatases involved in the two cycles of the cascade, we 
investigate the role of these converter enzymes in the oscillatory mechanism. Oscillations occur when the balance 
of kinase and phosphatase rates in each cycle is in a range bounded by two critical values. The results suggest ways 
to arrest the mitotic oscillator by altering the maximum rates of the converter enzymes. These results bear on the 
control of cell proliferation.
