  Model Status
</h2>
<p>
  This CellML model runs in COR and OpenCell and the units are consistent
  throughout. It reproduces the published results and was converted from
  SBML with the help of Lukas Endler. Validation was done in both CellML
  and Matlab, Matlab was used to simulate variations in GAP and R
  concentrations and to reproduce figures 3A and B.

  Model Structure
</h2>
<p>
  There is increasing evidence for a major and critical involvement of
  lipids in signal transduction and cellular trafficking, and this has
  motivated large-scale studies on lipid pathways. The Lipid Metabolites
  and Pathways Strategy consortium is actively investigating lipid
  metabolism in mammalian cells and has made available time-course data on
  various lipids in response to treatment with KDO(2)-lipid A (a
  lipopolysaccharide analog) of macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. The lipids
  known as eicosanoids play an important role in inflammation. We have
  reconstructed an integrated network of eicosanoid metabolism and
  signaling based on the KEGG pathway database and the literature and have
  developed a kinetic model. A matrix-based approach was used to estimate
  the rate constants from experimental data and these were further refined
  using generalized constrained nonlinear optimization. The resulting model
  fits the experimental data well for all species, and simulated enzyme
  activities were similar to their literature values. The quantitative
  model for eicosanoid metabolism that we have developed can be used to
  design experimental studies utilizing genetic and pharmacological
  perturbations to probe fluxes in lipid pathways.
