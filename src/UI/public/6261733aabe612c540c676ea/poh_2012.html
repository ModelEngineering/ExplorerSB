      This CellML model represents the human jejunal smooth muscle cell of the small intestine, and describes four slow waves with a 10s period.

      Abstract
    </h3>
    <p>
      Recently, a number of ion channel mutations have been identified in the smooth muscle cells of the human jejunum. Although these are potentially significant in understanding diseases that are currently of unknown etiology, no suitable computational cell model exists to evaluate the effects of such mutations. Therefore, a biophysically based single cell model of human jejunal smooth muscle electrophysiology was developed. The resulting cellular description is able to reproduce experimentally recorded slow wave activity and produces realistic responses to a number of perturbations, providing a solid platform on which the causes of intestinal myopathies can be investigated.
