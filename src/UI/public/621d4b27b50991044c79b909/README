This script contains the standard implementation of the
desensitization model, in which the drop in dopamine efflux
after administration of TC-7020 is caused by desensitization
of the a7 receptors under the influence of TC-7020.

Characteristics of the model are the predominant (or equal)
expression of a7 receptors on the dopamine neurons, and
the presence of a cholinergic tone.
