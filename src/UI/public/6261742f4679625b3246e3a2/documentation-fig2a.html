<h4>Figure 2A</h4>
<p align="justify">This is the general mathematical model for the <a href="Weinstein_2000_AE1_Fig2A.cellml"> AE1 </a> model with modifications to enable simulations which are capable of reproducing Figure 2A in the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10894785">original paper</a>. See the various views available in the right hand column. The simulation experiment for this model can be obtained by loading the <a href="Weinstein_2000_AE1_Fig2A.sedml">corresponding SED-ML document</a> into OpenCOR and executing the simulation. The results of which are shown below. A rendering of the mathematical model itself is available <a href="Weinstein_2000_AE1.cellml#cellml_math">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">In Figure 2A, the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> influx is computed for a range of external HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> when ambient Cl<sup>-</sup> is not present. Internal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration is fixed at 50 mM.</p>
