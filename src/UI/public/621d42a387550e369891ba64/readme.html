ISIs of acupuncture manipulations. Chaos, Solitons & Fractals 2008;

Abstract:

The Hodgkin-Huxley equations (HH) are parameterized by a number of
parameters and shows a variety of qualitatively different behaviors
depending on the parameter values. Under stimulation of an external
periodic voltage, the ISIs (interspike intervals) of a HH model are
investigated in this work, while the frequency of the voltage is taken
as the controlling parameter.  As well-known, the science of
acupuncture and moxibustion is an important component of Traditional
Chinese Medicine with a long history. Although there are a number of
different acupuncture manipulations, the method for distinguishing
them is rarely investigated. With the idea of ISI, we study the
electrical signal time series at the spinal dorsal horn produced by
three different acupuncture manipulations in Zusanli point and present
an effective way to distinguish them.


-------

To run the models:
XPP: start with the command
xppaut HH-ext.ode
This simulation will make graph similar to Figure 3 in the paper of
Wang et al.  Measurement of ISI can also be made under xpp.

describes how to get and use xpp.
