<h2>Model Status</h2>

<p>This CellML model runs in OpenCell and COR. It is based on 3 different models: the a model is the goldbeter_1995 model and the b model is the leloup_gonze_goldbeter_1999b model. Both are available in the CellMl model repository. The c model comes from this paper and is based on equations 2.9, 2.10 and 2.11 in the published paper.</p>

ABSTRACT: Circadian rhythms, which occur spontaneously with a period of about 24 h in a variety 
of organisms, allow their adaptation to the periodic variations of the environment. These 
rhythms are generated by a genetic regulatory network involving a negative feedback 
loop on transcription. Mathematical models based on the negative autoregulation of 
gene expression by the protein product of a clock gene account for the occurrence of self- 
sustained circadian oscillations. These models differ by their degree of complexity and, 
hence, by the number of variables considered. Some of these models can be considered as 
minimal because they contain a reduced number of biochemical processes and variables 
capable of producing sustained oscillations. In three of these minimal models, the period 
of the oscillations significantly changes with the rate of degradation of the clock protein. 
However, depending on the model considered, the period increases, decreases or passes 
through a maximum as a function of the protein degradation rate. We clarify the 
bases for these markedly different results by bringing to light the roles of (i) protein 
phosphorylation, which is required for protein degradation, and (ii) the velocity and 
degree of saturation of mRNA and protein degradation. Changes in the parameter values 
of the more complex of the minimal models can produce the period profiles observed in 
the other two models. The analysis allows us to reconcile the contradictory predictions 
for the dependence of the period on the clock protein degradation rate in three minimal 
models used to describe circadian rhythms. </p>
