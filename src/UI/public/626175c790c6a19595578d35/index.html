<p>The induced pluripotent stem-cell derived cardiomyocyte model by Kernik et al. from [1].</p>
<p>This implementation is based on the original Matlab code provided by the authors (<pre>ipsc_function.m</pre>, <pre>ICs_baseline.mat</pre> and <pre>baseline_parameter_inputs.mat</pre> as published for figure 10) [2].</p>
<p>It was verified against the original code by comparing the calculated derivatives.</p>
