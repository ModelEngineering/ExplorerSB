Abstract:

Oxcarbazepine (OXC), one of the newer anti-epileptic drugs, has been
demonstrating its efficacy on wide-spectrum neuropsychiatric
disorders. However, the ionic mechanism of OXC actions in neurons
remains incompletely understood. With the aid of patch-clamp
technology, we first investigated the effects of OXC on ion currents
in NG108-15 neuronal cells differentiated with cyclic AMP. We found
OXC (0.3-30 mum) caused a reversible reduction in the amplitude of
voltage-gated Na+ current (INa).  The IC50 value required for the
inhibition of INa by OXC was 3.1 mum. OXC (3 mum) could shift the
steady-state inactivation of INa to a more negative membrane potential
by approximately -9 mV with no effect on the slope of the inactivation
curve, and produce a significant prolongation in the recovery of INa
inactivation.  Additionally, OXC was effective in suppressing
persistent INa (INa(P)) elicited by long ramp pulses. The blockade of
INa by OXC does not simply reduce current magnitude, but alters
current kinetics. Moreover, OXC could suppress the amplitude of
delayed rectifier K+ current (IK(DR)), with no effect on M-type K+
current (IK(M)). In current-clamp configuration, OXC could reduce the
amplitude of action potentials and prolong action-potential
duration. Furthermore, the simulations, based on hippocampal pyramidal
neurons (Pinsky-Rinzel model) and a network of the Hodgkin-Huxley
model, were analysed to investigate the effect of OXC on action
potentials. Taken together, our results suggest that the synergistic
blocking effects on INa and IK(DR) may contribute to the underlying
mechanisms through which OXC affects neuronal function in vivo.
