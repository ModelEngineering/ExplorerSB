    <h3>Model Status</h3>
    <p>
      This model has been encoded using the information available in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00353.2001">published article</a>.
      Only the nodal part of the model has been implemented:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No equation to compute the membrane potential is provided.
        However, the model relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model#Voltage-gated_ion_channels">Hodgkin-Huxley formulation</a>, so we rely on that formulation to compute the membrane potential.
        We use <code>C<sub>n</sub></code> as the capacitance and <code>i<sub>Naf</sub></code>, <code>i<sub>Nap</sub></code>, <code>i<sub>Ks</sub></code> and <code>i<sub>Lk</sub></code> as the currents involved in the membrane dynamics.
        We also use <code>i<sub>Kf</sub></code>, but by default its conductance is set to <code>0 S/cm<sup>2</sup></code>.
        The authors mention that, based on experimental data, the value for <code>g<sub>Kf</sub></code> should be about <code>0.02 S/cm<sup>2</sup></code>, hence they tested their model using a range of values between <code>0.01</code> and <code>0.04 S/cm<sup>2</sup></code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        No initial values for the membrane potential (<code>V<sub>m</sub></code>) and the different gating variables (<code>m</code>, <code>h</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>s</code> and <code>n</code>) are provided.
        So, we set <code>V<sub>m</sub></code> to <code>-80 mV</code> (i.e. the resting potential used in the internodal segments) and the different gating variables to <code>0</code>.
        From there, the model was run without any stimulus and for several days worth of simulation to reach steady state.
      </li>
      <li>
        No information about the kind of stimulus that should be applied to generate a default action potential is provided.
        However, various stimulus durations are mentioned in the published article, varying between <code>0.1</code> and <code>3 ms</code>.
        So, we arbitrarily went for <code>0.5 ms</code>.
        As for the stimulus amplitude, we went for the smallest value that yields an action potential (actually, a series of action potentials), i.e. <code>0.05 mA/cm<sup>2</sup></code>.
        (A stimulus amplitude of <code>0.04 mA/cm<sup>2</sup></code> will just result in a blip.)
