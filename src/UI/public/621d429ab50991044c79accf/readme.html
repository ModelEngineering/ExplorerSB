 in cardiac repolarization and repolarization reserve.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: The role of IKs, the slow delayed rectifier K+ 
current, in cardiac ventricular repolarization has been a subject 
of debate. METHODS AND RESULTS: We develop a detailed Markov 
model of IKs and its alpha-subunit KCNQ1 and examine their 
kinetic properties during the cardiac ventricular action 
potential at different rates. We observe that interaction 
between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (the beta-subunit) confers kinetic 
properties on IKs that make it suitable for participation in 
action potential repolarization and its adaptation to rate 
changes; in particular, the channel develops an available reserve
of closed states near the open state that can open rapidly on 
demand. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its ability to form an available 
reserve, IKs can function as a repolarization reserve when IKr, 
the rapid delayed rectifier, is reduced by disease or drug and 
can prevent excessive action potential prolongation and 
development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations.

To run the models:
XPP: start with the command

xpp ode\IKs_Mar.ode

To make a trace similar to one in fig 3C of the paper:
Mouse click on Initialconds, and then (G)o.

To run the full family of voltage-clamp traces, 
click Range over, change the value to vtest_1.
Similarly set Steps:10, Start:-50, End:60, Reset Storage:N,
Cycle color:y, and click Ok.

This produces a graph like:

To run deactivation protocol, please change the value to vtest_2.
and then select a voltage protocol from Steps, Start and End.

Regarding xpp program, please contact with 
Bard Ermentrout's website http://www.pitt.edu/~phase/, which 
describes how to get and use xpp.
