These are the model files for the paper:

Rubin JE, Terman D (2004) High frequency stimulation of the
subthalamic nucleus eliminates pathological thalamic rhythmicity in a
computational model. J Comput Neurosci 16:211-35

These model files were supplied by Jonathan Rubin.

Example use:

Make sure you have xpp installed
(<a href="http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html">http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html</a>) and start with a command
(linux, although mac and windows xpp versions are available)

Select File -> Read and choose rubin_terman_pd.ode.setnorm or
rubin_terman_pd.ode.setpark for normal/PD
