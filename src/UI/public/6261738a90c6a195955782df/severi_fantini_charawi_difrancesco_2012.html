<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p><span>The cellular basis of cardiac pacemaking is still debated. Reliable computational models of the sinoatrial node (SAN) action potential (AP) may help gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Recently, novel models incorporating detailed Ca</span><sup>2+</sup><span>-handling dynamics have been proposed, but they fail to reproduce a number of experimental data, and more specifically effects of ‘funny' (</span><em>I</em><sub>f</sub><span>) current modifications. We therefore developed a SAN AP model, based on available experimental data, in an attempt to reproduce physiological and pharmacological heart rate modulation. Cell compartmentalization and intracellular Ca</span><sup>2+</sup><span>-handling mechanisms were formulated as in the Maltsev–Lakatta model, focusing on Ca</span><sup>2+</sup><span>-cycling processes. Membrane current equations were revised on the basis of published experimental data. Modifications of the formulation of currents/pumps/exchangers to simulate </span><em>I</em><sub>f</sub><span> blockers, autonomic modulators and Ca</span><sup>2+</sup><span>-dependent mechanisms (ivabradine, caesium, acetylcholine, isoprenaline, BAPTA) were derived from experimental data. The model generates AP waveforms typical of rabbit SAN cells, whose parameters fall within the experimental ranges: 352 ms cycle length, 80 mV AP amplitude, -58 mV maximum diastolic potential (MDP), 108 ms APD</span><sub>50</sub><span>, and 7.1 V s</span><sup>-1</sup><span> maximum upstroke velocity. Rate modulation by </span><em>I</em><sub>f</sub><span>-blocking drugs agrees with experimental findings: 20% and 22% caesium-induced (5 m</span><span class="sc">M</span><span>) and ivabradine-induced (3 µ</span><span class="sc">M</span><span>) rate reductions, respectively, due to changes in diastolic depolarization (DD) slope, with no changes in either MDP or take-off potential (TOP). The model consistently reproduces the effects of autonomic modulation: 20% rate decrease with 10 n</span><span class="sc">M</span><span>acetylcholine and 28% increase with 1 µ</span><span class="sc">M</span><span> isoprenaline, again entirely due to increase in the DD slope, with no changes in either MDP or TOP. Model testing of BAPTA effects showed slowing of rate, -26%, without cessation of beating. Our up-to-date model describes satisfactorily experimental data concerning autonomic stimulation, funny-channel blockade and inhibition of the Ca</span><sup>2+</sup><span>-related system by BAPTA, making it a useful tool for further investigation. Simulation results suggest that a detailed description of the intracellular Ca</span><sup>2+</sup><span>fluxes is fully compatible with the observation that </span><em>I</em><sub>f</sub><span> is a major component of pacemaking and rate modulation.</span></p>
