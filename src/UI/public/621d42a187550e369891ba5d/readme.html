role of ATP-sensitive potassium channel. J Neurosci Res 2007,
[Epub ahead of print]

Abstract:
Hyperglycemia-related neuronal excitability and epileptic seizures 
are not uncommon in clinical practice. However, their underlying 
mechanism remains elusive. ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels are 
found in many excitable cells, including cardiac myocytes, 
pancreatic beta cells, and neurons. These channels provide a link 
between the electrical activity of cell membranes and cellular 
metabolism. We investigated the effects of higher extracellular 
glucose on hippocampal K(ATP) channel activities and neuronal 
excitability. The cell-attached patch-clamp configuration on 
cultured hippocampal cells and a novel multielectrode recording 
system on hippocampal slices were employed. In addition, a 
simulation modeling hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (Pinsky-Rinzel 
model) was analyzed to investigate the role of K(ATP) channels in 
the firing of simulated action potentials. We found that incremental 
extracellular glucose could attenuate the activities of hippocampal 
K(ATP) channels. The effect was concentration dependent and involved 
mainly in open probabilities, not single-channel conductance. 
Additionally, higher levels of extracellular glucose could enhance 
neuropropagation; this could be attenuated by diazoxide, a K(ATP) 
channel agonist. In simulations, high levels of intracellular ATP, 
used to mimic increased extracellular glucose or reduced conductance 
of K(ATP) channels, enhanced the firing of action potentials in model 
neurons. The stochastic increases in intracellular ATP levels also 
demonstrated an irregular and clustered neuronal firing pattern. This 
phenomenon of K(ATP) channel attenuation could be one of the underlying 
mechanisms of glucose-related neuronal hyperexcitability and propagation.
